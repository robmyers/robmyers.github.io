        Latest FSF Newsletter Is Now Online
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">07 Dec 2007</span>

    <p>The latest FSF newsletter is now online:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fsf.org/bulletin/2007/fall/">http://www.fsf.org/bulletin/2007/fall/</a></p>

<p>There’s an interview with me at the back in which I discuss free art, free culture, collaborative authorship, how lovely the GPL 3 is and why it makes perfect sense that Free Software licences should tackle Tivoisation.</p>

<p>Before you get to that there are also articles by Ben Mako Hill, Brett Smith, Peter Brown and Ben Klemens, and a cartoon.</p>

<p>If you join the FSF you can get a print copy as well, among other benefits. <a href="https://www.fsf.org/associate/support_freedom?">Join here</a> and tell them I sent you.</p>

        FDL / BY-SA Compatibility and Wikipedia
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">02 Dec 2007</span>

    <p>Some good news on the BY-SA/FDL compatibility and Wikipedia relicencing fronts:</p>

<p><a href="http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Resolution:License_update">Resolution:License update - Wikimedia Foundation</a></p>

<p><a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7876"> Progress on license interoperability with Wikipedia</a></p>

<p><a href="http://lessig.org/blog/2007/12/some_important_news_from_wikip.html">Some important news from Wikipedia to understand clearly</a></p>

<p><a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/12/01/2032252">And the Slashdot discussion about this is a good mixture of FUD and answers as usual</a></p>

<p>The FSF moving towards BY-SA/SFDL compatibility and Wikipedia moving towards relicencing are all very good news.</p>

<p>An unexpected effect of all this seems to be renewed calls for BY-SA to have “stronger” copyleft, which would be a good thing if possible. It’s time to put aside legalistic objections (which have never been raised against NC’s conception of use) and community objections (which amount to a defence of breaking the social contract of copyleft) and try to move to stronger copyleft for BY-SA.</p>

    <span class="post-date">27 Nov 2007</span>

    <p>Apparently the download and payment figures I (and everyone else) have been commenting on were pulled out of the air by the people who published them. So we don’t know exactly how well the downloads of “In Rainbows” did.</p>

<p>But given that some people did pay for it, “In Rainbows” has paid better as downloads than it would have as a P2P leak. And I would re-iterate that unpaid downloads are comparable to promotional costs for CDs. So at worst this experiment has been something of a success and turned many eager fans into paying customers rather than copyright criminals.</p>

        Mantaray II

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">27 Nov 2007</span>

    <p>If I wanted to make this blog linkbait I would just post snarky comments about Goth icons’ latest offerings and watch the Adwords revenue come pouring in.</p>

<p>But I don’t. So when people get the wrong end of a slightly more nuanced stick than I feel they are giving me credit for I feel I need to revisit what I have written.</p>

<p>This means that I have four things to say about my comments on Mantaray:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>I like the album. I said I did. It has grown on me even more with repeated listening, and it was great to see Siouxsie on Later With Jools Holland.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I stand by my comments about Siouxsie’s inconsistent pronunciation of ts as ds. Compare even words in the same song never mind different songs or previous albums. I concede that I cannot know why this is the case.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also stand by my comments about the music. It is content by the traditional two producers. It is competent content, and probably all that is possible at this point in history, but it is still a <strong>comparative</strong> disappointment as a backing for such excellent vocals.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you love music then be willing to look inside the box rather than just accepting the marketing speak. Content isn’t questioned and makes no mistakes.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Just to re-iterate: I have some criticisms about Mantaray’s production (none of which are aimed at Siouxsie, who is on top form here) that I hope can be addressed for the next album, but it’s a very good album so go and buy it.</p>

        Support BY-SA/SFDL Compatibility, Not BY-SA/FDL Compatibility
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">24 Nov 2007</span>

    <p>With the Affero GPL released, the Free Software Foundation can now press on with revising the Free Documentation Licence (FDL).</p>

<p>Alongside the FDL the FSF have also proposed a Simpler Free Documentation Licence (SFDL). This is a great improvement on the FDL as it does not allow invariant sections.</p>

<p>Invariant Sections are the moral and practical equivalent of Adware. They allow advertising, obnoxious commentary and other irrelevences to be added to a document in such a way that you cannot remove them. When you share or modify a work these sections you must pay the price of imposing these sections on others if you wish to use the original work.</p>

<p>This is unacceptable in a Free licence, and is largely the product of the FSF’s desire to propagate the GNU Manifesto. More people should read the GNU manifesto, but not at the price that the FDL extracts. The answer to the FSF wanting to add the GNU Manifesto to their documentation should be “sure, just don’t make it invariant”, not “sure, as long as everybody else can add invariant adware as well.</p>

<p>If BY-SA was made compatible with the FDL, Invariant sections could be imposed on derivatives of BY-SA works. This would be unfair on BY-SA licensors, and might effectively alienate them from otherwise usable derivatives of their work.</p>

<p>The SFDL imposes no such price on derivatives and so BY-SA/SFDL compatibility is not problematic.</p>

<p>The SFDL is also compatible with FDL work that has not invariant sections (but not vice versa), making it compatible with Wikipedia. If Wikipedia went to SFDL then it could be BY-SA compatible.</p>

<p>For these reason, when commenting on the FDL revision web site, discussing this on mailing lists, or blogging about it, please call for BY-SA/SFDL compatibility, not BY-SA/FDL compatibility.</p>

<p>And if you believe that Invariant Sections are bad (which they are), ask the FSF to deprecate the FDL in favour of the SFDL. Eben Moglen did say that Invariant Sections would be gone at one stage, the community should push for this again.</p>
