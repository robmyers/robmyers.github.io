        Why The NC Permission Culture Simply Doesn't Work

    <p>In “Free Culture” Lawrence Lessig described a perfect storm of law, technology, media mergers and divergent social norms that had broken the tradition of free culture. Now Lessig has the solution to this problem: a NonCommercial economy of sharing and reputation building.</p>

<p>This seems like an elegant solution. Individuals can create and share and build on work freely without being unfairly exploited commercially. When they have built their reputation to the point where they can monetize their work, they have still retained their commercial rights. And the ability to withhold a propritary licence gives creators much needed protection for their reputation. If value, then right. If right, then value.</p>

<p>Sharing without creators having to accept harm to their earning ability or their good name in exchange for freedom. Who could disagree with such a perfect system? You would have to be a free content (sic) zealot, or even a Debian free software fanatic who doesn’t want artists to make any money because making money is wrong. Possibly even a communalist (see Wikipedia for a definition of the last term).</p>

<p>On the surface these are powerful memes to argue against. But if we scratch off the shiny gloss of this argument we find that they are ethically and economically broken.</p>

<p>Creators who reserve a right of creative fiat may see that same right exercised against them, and they will appreciate it much less in those circumstances. This is a permission culture, not a free culture.</p>

<p>Creators who release their work at no cost under an NC licence will have to compete with their own work available gratis if they ever try to monetize the same work. This makes NC at least as effective at destroying earning ability as other CC licences allegedly are while giving less freedom and returning less value as well.</p>

<p>And creators who use work made by others will have to pay for that use if they wish to charge for their own work. Which may make producing documentaries, to take one of Lessig’s own canonical examples, impossible to meet the costs of unless the artist has already entered into proprietary culture. This is an economic permission culture, but still a permission culture.</p>

<p>But at least nobody will get ripped off. No starving artists will be exploited to make middlemen multimillionaires without giving so much as a digital tip to the people who make their fortune possible. This is Web 2.0, everybody shares. And the people who enable the sharing are peers with the creators…</p>

<p>…Right up to the moment where one of the survivors of the first web bubble or an even older media corporation buys those enablers out. Then all that NC work makes somebody millions, and it isn’t the people who made the NC work.</p>

<p>Pleading for NC in the name of artists is, as ever, pleading for middlemen. Creative Commons’s NC licence very carefully redefines US law to define peer to peer sharing as noncommercial. You don’t even have to get bought out, you can charge people for using pipes or pods rather than selling them a CD. Given a choice between having to pay artists who might resonate with the public enough to recover their advance or being able to guarantee making much more money just by paying off a couple of hackers, media corporation executives are more than capable of spotting which option offers maximum return to their shareholders.</p>

<p>So as well as its other problems NC protects against a business model that was dying when NC was being drafted but delivers its users up wholesale to the profiteers of the Web 2.0 bubble without any need for compensation. Opposing this NonCommercial Permission culture is not simple-minded idealism, it is basic economics.</p>

    <p>The latest Debian updates to sid have fucked up my iBook. I can have it boot and not use the network, or not boot and presumably use the network. Which is a bit Schrodinger.</p>

<p>This has driven home how good Debian was precisely up to this moment. ;-)</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> It tries to make the ramdisk but the boot process can’t find the ramdisk?</p>

<p>E: linux-image-2.6.18-1-powerpc: subprocess post-installation script returned error exit status 2<br />
E: linux-image-2.6-powerpc: dependency problems - leaving unconfigured</p>

<p>Post parameter wrong in script?</p>

<p>Anyone? :-)</p>

    <p>First and Last and Always, Floodland and Vision Thing by The Sisters of Mercy have been reissued on Rhino Records. The albums all have additional tracks (b-sides, cover versions, and demos), new liner notes, and new typos on the covers. You can, and should, buy them from any online record store.<br />
The stand out addition is the full version of “Never Land” on Floodland, a track that lead singer Andrew Eldritch has always denied the existence of. Their cover version of Hot Chocolate’s “Emma” and the First &amp; Last era B-Sides are welcome additions as well.<br />
This is music as it should be. Wildly, vividly, stupidly brilliant. Ironic and cynical yet heartfelt and entertaining. Timeless yet possible at no other time. It has, it must be said, a good beat to it. Even Vision Thing sounds better second Bush round.<br />
If any record companies have been considering paying Eldritch the large sums in unmarked notes he’s demanding for another album, now would be a good time.</p>

        Future of Copyright: Roundtable 3 - Law, regulation and the future

    <span class="post-date">28 Oct 2006</span>

    <p>This looks like it was an excellent debate.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.openrightsgroup.org/2006/10/26/future-of-copyright-roundtable-3-law-regulation-and-the-future/">The Open Rights Group : Blog Archive » Future of Copyright: Roundtable 3 - Law, regulation and the future<br />

<p>_ Can copyright protect art from becoming a business activity. What I don’t mean is can certain individual artists use copyright to protect their works against business, but can copyright be used to protect the commons? Lots of contemporary artists have the primary concern of their resistance to business. Is copyright forcing people to be small commodity producers, when this is not what they want to be._</p>

<p>Historically, art is either a business activity or a distraction for the independently wealthy. It is as dangerous to see art as not being a business as to see it as only a market. The humorous description of art as “middle sized dry goods” serves as a useful illustration of what the extents to art’s relation to the market should be, from both sides.</p>

<p>An essay in Art &amp; Language New York’s journal “The Fox” from the 1970s discusses the state-funded art of what was then Communist Yugoslavia and describes how the absence of any necessity to either the production or consumption of art created mediocrity through bureaucracy.</p>

<p>Bureaucratic attempts to induce and manage the creation of culture, to guarantee the creation of cultural value, whether state or corporate bureaucracy, destroy cultural value. This can be used both as an argument for markets and as an argument for art’s autonomy. There is no contradiction, it is only when art has no necessity or becomes ideologically instrumentalized that there is a problem. Sadly both are the case in the contemporary art market.</p>

<p>All this said, in the UK some of the most successful artists and musicians of today started out being supported by the state, on unemployment benefits.</p>

<p><em>The answer is no. Introduced race relations act and sexual discrimination act in the late 60s, but things might not be worse but are not much better. Law is part of a social system and so reflect social values. What law tries to do is channel social and political conflict into what lawyers see as technical disputes. It’s interpretations of rules. To the extent that copyright is associated with two or three major cultural or philosophical ways in which the world has arranged itself in the last 300 years, of property, rights, these things are a part of a coherent development that’s lasted 100 years.</em></p>

<p><em>You are asking copyright law to do something revolutionary. People thought in the 60s that you pass a race relation act and racism goes away, and we’ve seen it doesn’t.</em></p>

<p>But it helps. The social change that those acts are a reflection of are protected by them.</p>

<p><em>If the property right is so over-valued and its transmission is like shares in a company instead of the rights of an individual creator then the kind of exploitation we’ve described becomes an easy shot. Can we minimise that?</em></p>

<p><em>The question was can we use copyright law to have a revolution, and the answer is no.</em></p>

<p>Exactly. Copyleft is reform. It is unlikely to bring about a revolution, but it can prevent a collapse. It can be disruptive, and this disruption may appear revolutionary. This disruption is more a restoration than the creation of anything new. Which is disappointing to radicals and to venture capitalists. But it is vitally important to artists.</p>
