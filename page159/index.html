    <p>“<a href="http://www.ghostbox.co.uk/theowlsmap.htm">The Owls Map</a>” by Belbury Poly is very good. It’s the synth music you almost remember from your 1970s schooldays (even if you didn’t have them) but with undercurrents of The Wicker Man. Tangerine Dream, Jarre, Kraftwerk, they’re not English but they are from the same logical universe as Tomorrow’s World and complement the incidental music-style warmth and whimsy of some of the other reference points of this sound. There’s also hints of the evils of morris dancing and just a dash of real old folk sung by real old folk . The production is cleaner and less radiophonic workshop this time. I preferred the more analogue sound quality of “The Willows” but this is good stuff. Music with its own mythology and a rich, nuanced sound. Ghost Box are definitely onto something.</p>

<p><em>This sharing economy is not meant to displace the commercial economy. Its purpose is not to force Madonna to sing for free.</em></p>

<p>Free Software is not meant to displace the commercial economy, which has benefited greatly from it. But this is not about displacing or working with commerce, it is about Freedom.</p>

<p>_The next challenge is to figure out how this sharing economy interacts with a traditional commercial economy. _</p>

<p>Freedom and commerce are not separate magisteria. This sharing economy interacts with commerce by commercial actors having Freedom and not denying it to individuals.<br />
The Gift Economy, as it used to be known, is a reification of one of the possible products of Freedom. As its proponents argue it is a more efficient method of production. And this more efficient means of production can be applied to culture very successfully as Wikipedia shows. But it is important to not confuse this benefit with its causes and to try to substitute other causes such as money or politics.</p>

<p>Copyleft projects are just part of free culture. We need to defeat DRM, protect and extend Fair Use, ensure that consumer rights are not ignored, defend fair speech, oppose censorship, and ensure that the Internet is not over-regulated. Copyleft has a part to play in all this. Copyleft projects do not need walling off in the mysterious gardens of reputation or sharing. So we need more than CC for Free Culture, but we do not need CC to do less than copyleft.<br />
__</p>

<p><em>CC will never become a part of that commercial economy. But it is important, I believe, that we play a role in enabling this crossover. The alternative is a world we’re seeing too much of all ready: large entities that create sandboxes for “sharing,” but then effectively claim ownership over everything built within that sandbox. This is, in my view, not a sharing economy. It is instead simple sharecropping.</em></p>

<p>And the greatest tool it has is the NC licence, which creates nothing if not an immense sandbox.</p>

<p>It is telling that Lessig regards the creators of a YouTube viral advertisement using NC music without observing the licence then paying the musician when they got caught as a success story. It is a success story for the New Permission Culture, not Free Culture.</p>

        More New Permission Culture

    <p><a href="http://icommons.org/2006/10/16/dinner-with-magnatunes-john-buckman/">http://icommons.org/2006/10/16/dinner-with-magnatunes-john-buckman/</a></p>

<p><em>In my perspective, Creative Commons is not about non-commercial use, but about open culture. I am trying to make Magnatune a good example of how the commons does not exclude commercial use. There needs to be incentives for artists and great people to share, and to use Creative Commons. It seems that CC is now battling to find the balance between what is ‘commercial’ and non-commercial’. But from Larry Lessig‘ book, Free Culture, I reckon that the controversy of ‘commercial versus non-commercial’ use, is actually the battle of ‘permission culture versus open culture’.</em><br />
John is absolutely right about this, and it is immensely disheartening to see the mistakes that Lessig is currently making.<br />
But Magnatune makes music available noncommercially for free. You have to ask permission to use it commercially. Magnatune therefore excludes commercial use from their ‘commons’, pushing it into a proprietary licence system. This is a permission culture.</p>

<p>If we believe, Lessig-style, that artists need financial incentives to produce work, this permission culture is actually a disincentive.</p>

<p>And there are so many problems with commercial ventures acting as a gatekeeper for permission. What happens in five years time when Magnatune shut down and I cannot get a proprietary licence with the same low overhead any more? What happens if I do not become a Magnatune artist and wish to pass on my freedom (sic) to a third party? What happens in seventy years time when the musicians are dead and my grandchildren wish to use the now orphan works? What happens if I am not a multimillionaire and all those thirty dollar economic permissions will stop me performing my “Endtroducing” or my “Paul’s Boutique”?</p>

<p>The measures being proposed by Lessig are the very ones that killed sampling artistically in the 1990s. Incentivizing “producers” killed production.</p>

<p>Lessig is falling into the trap of trying to reproduce the supply-side<br />
economics of big media. Middlemen need financial incentives. Artists need to make a living. There is an important difference there.</p>

<p>We need a distributed, rights based culture to protect the conversation of<br />
culture when things go wrong. Not a centralized, permission based economy to<br />
incentivize distributors when things are going right.<br />
_<br />
I have a very different definition of the ‘commons’ actually. The ‘commons’ is<br />
a pool of culture, made available for you to reuse without needing to seek<br />
permission from the original creators, at a reasonable price._</p>

<p>This is an unusual definition of a ‘commons’. Although the “original creators”<br />
cannot refuse artistic permission, the system can refuse economic permission.<br />
This is an economic permission culture rather than an artistic one, but it is<br />
still a permission culture.</p>

<p><em>I think it is all right to charge the price, as long as the price is not the<br />
barrier to reusing it.</em></p>

<p>This is one of the foundations of Free Software. But Free Software gives freedom generally to paying users, whereas NC requires extra permission to charge the price that makes the work usable in an economic context (or for the artist to offset their costs).</p>

<p>If the work is NC, permission will always potentially be a barrier to use unless, like Lessig currently, we take a “let them eat cake” view of free culture as an economically inexplicable ghetto of reputational or gift economics.</p>

<p>If we are discussing a free culture or an open society, Lessig’s New Permission<br />
Culture simply doesn’t fit. It is harder to get people to use street performer<br />
protocol or whatever than to get them to add a cashback link to their NC work<br />
that no-one will ever use and that won’t work when they change hosts. But we<br />
need to do the hard work of freedom rather than look for easy technological<br />
fixes and close approximations.</p>

        The Affero Clause
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">21 Oct 2006</span>

    <p>The Affero clause feels right intuitively, but is it? What problem is it trying to address for software users? And in what way are we users of the software that it covers?</p>

<p>Matt Lee (CNUK) has argued that the Affero clause will burden end users of CRM software more than the likes of Google. And if I have to make all the code of my CRM installation available, what happens to my database_password.php file?</p>

<p>Crosbie Fitch (FCUK) has argued that the Affero clause confuses public and private use of software, making the GPL into a “gift economy” license rather than a rights-based license by emphasising sharing (distribution) over use.</p>

<p>These are persuasive arguments but they do not alter the fact that web-serivicization of Free Software looks and smells like Tivoization. In both cases the freedom to use (in the FSD sense of “use”, what I call “Mere Use”) software that was previously Free is denied to the user by measures not accounted for in GPL-2.</p>

<p>Web services use xml-rpc to firewall Free code inside the private space of an organization. AJAX is software executing half in your public web browser and half on a private server, again using xml-rpc or a similar method of remote procedure invocation as a firewall. And it is the fact that we are discussing method invocation that is the key. This is not a public/private or “sharing” issue. It is as an issue of how we conceive of “linking” and of “distribution” or of public use. Web services and AJAX count as providing software publicly for linking to or use by virtue of their technical construction. Their “semantics of communication”, as the GPL FAQ puts it (<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html</a>).</p>

<p>Perhaps then we should not think of the Affero clause as a gift-economy clause bolted on to the GPL. Instead we should think of it as a special exception for those who wish to use Free Software without giving users the freedom to tinker with the running code that Free Software normally provides. In return for this, fairly massive, exception they only have to observe the terms of the GPL that they are still capable of observing. Such as the public disclosure term.</p>

<p>The Affero clause is therefore still about Freedom, not “sharing”. It is the LGPL for the age of REST. If the circumstances you have created will deny me Freedom here, the Affero clause says, at least let me have it elsewhere.</p>
