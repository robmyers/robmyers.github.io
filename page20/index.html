    <p>I’ve bought a Kobo Touch ebook reader device to hack on.</p>

<p>This guide to setting up a build environment for the Kobo is good:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?p=2176378#post2176378">http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?p=2176378#post2176378</a></p>

<p>The only change I’ve found you have to make to build the examples is to add:</p>

<p><code>LIBS += -lpng -lz</code></p>

<p>to the Qt project (.pro) file in Sketch.</p>

<p>The build system defaults to 4.6.2. It’s possible to change the build scripts to use Qt 4.8 (<code>grep -r 4.6 ~/kobo/KoboLabs/build/*</code> and change occurrences of 4.6.2 to 4.8, then update the ./configure line). Both are on the device so using 4.6.2 is fine.</p>

<p>I’d like to replace Sourcery G++ with something without a EULA.</p>

        Connecting To LambdaMOO Persistently
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">18 Nov 2012</span>

    <p>It’s easy to connect to LambdaMOO whenever you wish from mobile devices or desktop computers, but you can miss out on what’s happening when you’re not online. If you have a desktop computer that you keep permanently online you can keep a MOO client open on it, but then you cannot connect on the move.</p>

<p>If you have a shell account on a server (a server account that allows you to run programs on from the command line rather than just serve web pages) you can run a MOO client there and connect to it from your mobile devices or other computers. This combines the advantages of an always-on connection to the MOO with the advantages of being able to connect wherever you may be.</p>

<p>There are two ways of creating accessible persistent connections, each with its own advantages and disadvantages:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>You can run TinyFugue in a GNU Screen session, which allows you to connect securely using an SSH client. What you gain in security you may lose in spell checking on mobile devices.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Alternatively you can run Mooproxy, which integrates better with dedicated MOO clients but still uses the insecure Telnet protocol to communicate with your server.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="tinyfugue-in-a-gnu-screen-session">TinyFugue In A GNU Screen Session</h2>

<p>TinyFugue can be run in an ssh session on a server, but when you disconnect it will exit. To create a persistent TinyFugue session you can run it in GNU Screen. When you run Screen, it opens a new command line terminal that will continue running even when you disconnect from the server. And anything that you run within Screen will keep running as well. You can then reconnect to Screen the next time you connect to the server, and your TinyFugue session will still be running.</p>

<p>Setting up SSH connections to a server is outside the scope of this article. SSH clients are available for every desktop and mobile operating system. Install one, and find out how to set up public key authentication from it to your server.</p>

<p>To install TinyFugue and Screen on a GNU/Linux server you will need to be able to run commands as an administrator. You install them using the command-line package manager on the server by typing something like:</p>

<p><code>sudo apt-get install tf5 screen</code></p>

<p>or</p>

<p><code>sudo yum install tf5 screen</code></p>

<p>Next, set up the .tfrc file in your home directory:</p>

<p><code>echo "/world lambdamoo lambda.moo.mud.org Guest" &gt;&gt; ~/.tfrc</code></p>

<p>or, if you have a registered character:</p>

<p><code>echo "/world lambdamoo lambda.moo.mud.org USERNAME PASSWORD" &gt;&gt; ~/.tfrc</code></p>

<p>You only need to do that once.</p>

<p>Then you can start a Screen session with tinyfugue running in it by typing:</p>

<p><code>screen tf5</code></p>

<p>You don’t need to quit the MOO or TinyFugue when you wish to leave, just close the SSH connection.</p>

<p>Then when you reconnect, type:</p>

<p><code>screen -DRRU</code></p>

<p>This will reconnect to your previous screen session. If for some reason the session has ended, for example if the server has been rebooted, you can restart TinyFugue once Screen starts by typing:</p>

<p><code>tf5</code></p>

<p>When you reconnect to Screen from a different device your new connection will inherit the TinyFugue session any other devices will lose access to it.</p>

<h2 id="mooproxy">Mooproxy</h2>

<p>Mooproxy is a buffering network proxy for MOO connections. It runs on your server keeping a persistent connection open to the MOO, and then you connect your MOO client to it rather than to the MOO.</p>

<p>To install it type:</p>

<p><code>sudo apt-get install mooproxy</code></p>

<p>or:</p>

<p><code>sudo yum install mooproxy</code></p>

<p>To configure it, generate a hash of your connection command for LambdaMOO:</p>

<p>`mooproxy –md5crypt</p>

<p>connect CHARACTER PASSWORD`</p>

<p>and make a note of the string that mooproxy prints in return.</p>

<p>Then create the file:</p>

<p><code>~/.mooproxy/worlds/lambdamoo</code></p>

<p>(you may need to create the <code>~/.mooproxy/worlds</code> directory using:
<code>mkdir -p ~/.mooproxy/worlds/</code> )</p>

<p>and enter the following into it:</p>

<p><code># The port to listen to on *your* server
listenport = 8899
# The hash of your connection command, for security
auth_md5hash = "THE HASH OF YOUR CONNECTION COMMAND FROM moocode --md5hash"
# The actual MOO server address
host = "lambda.moo.mud.org"
# Tha actual MOO server port
port = 8888
# Connect to the MOO automatically on start
autologin = true
# Reconnect to the MOO if the connection is lost
autoreconnect = true
# Lines starting with this character will be interpreted as command to mooproxy
commandstring = "/"
# Mooproxy should send this many lines of history to you when you connect
context_on_connect = 100</code></p>

<p>To set it running in the background as a daemon, type:</p>

<p><code>mooproxy -w lambdamoo</code></p>

<p>This will start mooproxy using the settings from the world file <code>~/.mooproxy/worlds/lambdamoo</code> .</p>

<p>To connect to LambdaMOO, set your MOO client to connect to ,ooproxy on your server. Use your character name and password for LambdaMOO , but rather than using LambdaMOO’s host name and port, use the host name and port of the server that you are running mooproxy on.</p>

<p>As with screen/TinyFugue, if you connect to mooproxy from a different device your new connection will inherit the mooproxy session any other devices will lose access to it.</p>

<p>To debug your mooproxy connection, you can check its logs at:</p>

<p><code>~/.mooproxy/logs/lambdamoo/</code></p>

<p>The most common errors are to not enter the correct connection string when running ` mooproxy –md5crypt`, or to not open the port that you have set mooproxy to use in the firewall.</p>

    <p><a href="/assets/2012/11/g4.png"><img src="/assets/2012/11/g4.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>I bought a Wacom Inkling pen. It digitizes what you draw as you draw it on paper so you can upload it to computer later. The software that manages uploading those drawings to computer is proprietary and not available for GNU/Linux.</p>

<p>Forunately <a href="http://www.useful-tools.de/EN-WPI-Format-Downloads.html">someone created a C++ class</a> to parse the “WPI” files that the Inkling creates. It’s under the GPLv3 so anyone can use and build on it. I changed the code slightly to compile on platforms other than Windows, then wrapped it up in a command-line tool that outputs simple SVG. Inkscape reads the results just fine. There are also scripts to batch convert and batch copy/convert drawings from the Inkling.</p>

<p>The project is called “merest”.  I need to scale the pixel values and retain the original drawing’s information about pressure and angle in a future version of my code. This version is perfectly usable, and has an Autotools-based build system that makes installing as simple as running <code>./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; sudo make install</code> , so I am releasing it.</p>

<p>You can get the code here: <a href="https://gitorious.org/robmyers/merest">https://gitorious.org/robmyers/merest</a></p>

        Connecting To LambdaMOO With Editor Clients
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">16 Sep 2012</span>

    <p>Some more advanced MOO clients go beyond simply enabling you to connect to the MOO. They also support editing of the content of the MOO using their own interface rather than the MOO’s built-in facilities. This is often more convenient and flexible than using the MOO’s built in text editor. These clients are all cross-platform.</p>

<h2 id="rmoo">RMOO</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/toddsundsted/rmoo">https://github.com/toddsundsted/rmoo</a></p>

<p>RMOO is a MOO client for the GNU Emacs text editor. It will run anywhere Emacs runs. RMOO allows you to edit notes, mail and code in separate Emacs buffers and then send them back to the MOO.</p>

<p>Emacs is the ultimate customisable programming environment, so implementing a MOO client in it gives you access to a wide range of useful tools to use when writing and editing for the MOO.</p>

<h2 id="tkmoo">TkMOO</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.awns.com/tkMOO-light/">http://www.awns.com/tkMOO-light/</a></p>

<p>TkMOO is a MOO client implemented in the TCL scripting language. It will run anywhere the “wish” TCL/Tk interpreter is installed.</p>

<p>Note that you may need to edit the code to refer to a more modern version of wish before it will run.</p>
