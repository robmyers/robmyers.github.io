    <p>Also at KIAD was David Platt:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.davidplattartist.co.uk/">http://www.davidplattartist.co.uk/</a></p>

<p>David’s an astonishingly good painter and philosopher.</p>

<p>His heptalectical logic is a “supplementary world view”, very ‘pataphysical:</p>

<p>And he was the first person I met who was big on Adorno:</p>

<p>Take a look.</p>

        Free Culture And Free Software
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">29 May 2007</span>

    <p>Free Software as described by Stallman comes from the fact that software  is functional, it is basically a machine. A novel, a play, a painting or  a concerto are not functional, they are not machines. So we cannot use  the same arguments that Stallman advances for software, and the freedoms  are not necessarily the same. For cultural artefacts represented as  software, Stallman’s freedoms do apply but this is because the work is  software. The claims of some artists that blahblahblah do not change this.</p>

<p>For cultural work in general you do actually need very similar freedoms  to those that you need for software. This is partly an accident (source  code is regarded as literary work for the purposes of copyright) and  partly because public culture in an open society must not close off  comment, critique, study or succession. This requires that you be free  to analyse, copy and modify the work.</p>

<p>The minimal freedom that you need for cultural works is Extended Fair  Use (XFU) as described by Negativland. I think that Stallman and Lessig  agree on this despite Stallman’s writing about functional, opinion and  expressive works (Stallman’s simple “you can copy this essay unmodified”  license should make its support for Fair Use explicit). Copyleft is a  superset of XFU, it gives you all the freedom of XFU and more, but it  frightens the horses economically speaking.</p>

<p>I agree that it does not make sense to try to live on Free Culture  alone. Reform is needed in the mainstream, we cannot reproduce the last  70 years of culture in the way that the GNU project has recreated a  functional equivalent of UNIX. There is no functional equivalency in  culture, and there is no way we can catch up on seventy years worth of  work in every medium rather than fifteen years worth of work in a single  medium (as UNIX was in 1984). It is very important to lobby for legal  reform in the name of Free Culture.</p>

<p>But this does not make alternative licenses useless by any means. We can  use Free Software’s tactic of producing a free alternative in order to  place pressure on a proprietary project could be effective. The  existence of a pool of self-identified freedom can show the need for  broader freedom when lobbying. And it may be ethical to produce one’s  own work with the freedom that one would wish to enjoy generally.</p>

<p><em>Via FC-Discuss. Paragraph 2 is a concise statement of a much longer essay I am working on.</em></p>

        The Aura Of The Aura

    <p><a href="/weblog/2003/04/25/finding-the-aura/">Finding The Aura</a></p>

<p>I have an electromagnetic field meter and there’s a show of abstract art on in town. I’m going looking for <strong>the aura of art</strong>.</p>

<p>The thinking behind this is simple. Ghosts cannot be recorded by conventional means but paranormal researchers report that hauntings are often accompanied by anomalous electromagnetic field fluctuations. Like ghosts, the aura of art is intangible So if artworks have an aesthetic aura we would expect to see this manifesting in similar electromagnetic phenomena to ghosts. Additionally we would expect the phenomena to be stronger for more aesthetic works and weaker for less aesthetic works.</p>

<p>By grading works aesthetically, recording any change in electromagnetic field strength around them, and then correlating the results we can gather proof for the aura of art. This can then be compared against data collected on works that claim to be non-auratic such as dadaist and conceptual art.</p>

<p>The danger in gathering such data is that it could be used to create a damping field for the aura of art, or even perhaps a “Ghostbusters”-style trap or containment system for the aura. I’m certainly not proposing firing high-energy particle beams at artworks. Unless they’re by Tracey Emin or Gavin Turk.</p>

<p><em>This project is brought to you by _<strong>_SPAR_</strong></em> (the Society for Paranormal Aesthetic Research)._</p>

<p>Have a look at the base of this Marcel Duchamp readymade from 1920.</p>

<p>I think that the assertion of copyright is being used here to help assert the reality of an imaginary personality, an imaginary author (Duchamp’s alter ego Rose Selavy).</p>
