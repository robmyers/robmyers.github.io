<p>This is the electronics for the Forepaw, my <a href="http://sensebridge.net/projects/northpaw/">North Paw</a> clone. It consists of a <a href="http://www.pololu.com/catalog/product/1250">compass module</a>, an <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardProMini">Arduino microcontroller</a>, a <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/ShiftOut">shift register</a>, and eight <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/8449">vibration motors</a> (such as you would find in a mobile phone). And a battery connector, battery case, some veroboard, some ribbon cable and some bell wire. You may just be able to see that the fifth vibration motor from the end of the ribbon cable is vibrating.</p>

<p>Next I need to add a case for the circuit boards and add velcro and fabric to the ribbon cable.</p>

<p>You can find the source code and some construction notes <a href="https://gitorious.org/robmyers/forepaw">on Gitorious</a> . A big thank you to <a href="http://www.digitalcrusader.ca/">Eric Boyd</a> from <a href="http://sensebridge.com/">Sensebridge</a> who gave me some insight into the construction of the original North Paw when we met at the Quantified Self conference.</p>

    <p>irc is an old text-based internet chat system that still gets used by many projects.</p>

<p>irssi is a good client for irc. You can find out how to set it up, including how to configure it to automatically connect to servers and channels <a href="http://tech-newbie.blogspot.com/2008/04/how-to-install-and-use-irssi-linux-irc.html">here</a> .</p>

<p>It’s best to run irssi in a GNU screen session on a remote server and then connect to that when you want to chat. This allows you to keep track of conversations in channels even when you are not online. Here’s a script to do this. Save it as irc somewhere on your PATH (e.g. in the bin directory in your HOME), chmod +x it, and then it’s easy.</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
SSH_HOST=your.host.name.possibly.of.the.form.username@your.host.name
IRSSI_SESSION=irc
ssh -t ${SSH_HOST} "screen -dr ${IRSSI_SESSION} || \
screen -S ${IRSSI_SESSION} irssi"

    <p>“Railing” refers to “Never Let Me Down Again” by Depeche Mode, “True Faith” by New Order, “Ash Wednesday” and “Gerontion”by T.S. Eliot, and a large stuffed toy tiger in a living room. Sometimes in the same line.</p>

<p>“Running For The Gates” refers to every time I wasn’t shot while at an airport, specifically to being late for a connecting flight for SXSW, and to being too tired to answer the phone.</p>

<p>“Wide Of The Mark” refers to NASA’s Genesis probe, Gerontion again and “The Waste Land”, “A Design For Life” by the Manic Street Preachers, “Dominion”, “This Corrosion” and “Some Kind Of Stranger” by The Sisters Of Mercy, “Like Eating Glass” by Bloc Party, and “Slow Hands” by Interpol.</p>

<p>“Kindness” refers to “Railing”, “I Don’t Want To Talk About It” by Rod Stewart as performed by Everything But The Girl, and Shakespeare’s “Julius Caesar”. Almost.</p>

<p>I may even publish the rest of these some day.</p>

<p><strong>“A number of preoccupations surround my practise within VR such as:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
How ideas and concepts might be described through the medium of VR?  

The medium's strengths and weaknesses.  

Are there features that belong only to the VR medium? If so what are
they?  

The participation and encouragement of the viewer and the control (or
lack) of the artist.  

Blurring the edges of real and unreal.  

The illusory nature of the medium, and how to respect and yet also
challenge the way we interpret space, place and the objects within them.  

Where the translation of elements of literal 'reality' are useful and
where they should not be considered.

<p>My projects are a series of experiments looking at the use of VR as
an art medium. relationships in VR of space and place, the illusory
nature of VR.</p>

<p>The revelation of spaces according to the movement of the user. it
focuses on methods to encourage user participation within worlds by
visual methods. My most recent works centre around the creation of a
virtual system that supports and encourages the viewer through a yet
unmade virtual landscape. I designed a system to generate on-the-ï¬‚y
virtual ‘zones’ around the viewer. The randomness of zones is affected
only by the viewers choice of movement through the work. The viewer
creates their own piece of the work. The system then records the 3D
virtual map generated behind the viewer to leave a sense of constancy
and an individual path they can retrace if they wish. It is expected
that each map will be different.</p>

<p>I am using this work as a vehicle to explore the notions of the
permanent, temporary and transient ‘structures’ within the medium of VR
and also within computer and viewer memory.”</p>

<p><strong>Tracey Matthieson</strong> has just finished her part time research MA
at the Centre for Electronic Arts at Middlesex University. She chose to
research existing Virtual Environments and create her own experimental
spaces. Her intention through her experimental work is to offer an
alternative to existing interpretations of the uses of VR. Programming
support for the “catalyst map” system was from Rob Myers.</p>
