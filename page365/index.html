    <p>In cultural studies, all the world’s a text and all the men and women in it are but signifiers. Art is a poor cousing of text, as text is more like text than art is.<br />
In computing, when a program is copied from memory to a disk so it can be restored later, it’s called an image. When an entire computer disk is copied for a backup or to be moved to another computer, it’s called an image (or sometimes a mirror). Programs do have “TEXT” sections, but those aren’t the important bits.<br />
So hackers have ot it right, anyway. :-)</p>

    <p>Margaret Boden described true, historically-unprecedented creativity (“H-Creativity”) as adding an additional dimension to the search space (I think - I’m paraphrasing badly here). Everyone should read “The Creative Mind”, especially me as I can’t remember the section I want to quote from. :-)</p>

<p>Edward DeBono describes creativity as “making novel associations” IIRC, and came up with a theory of how this works in the 1960s. I recommend “Serious Creativity” as a good introduction to his work. His techniques will be familiar to the artificial creativity researcher: random association, conceptual slippage, working backwards, etc., but he describes them for human beings to use rather than AIs.</p>

<p>Douglas Hofstadter describes a system that build, rebuilds, analyses and operates on its own descriptions of its problem space in “Fluid Analogies”.</p>

<p>There is no reason why we cannot create an AI (or whatever) that combines these approaches. If we take a set of weighted low-level concepts (like role-playing game skills: strong 75, blue 11, breakable 4, bendy 120), assemble sets of them to describe concepts, map these onto points in the search space and then allow the search space and the concepts to be modified we’re away. The Tony Buzan book with the 40,000 concept personal memory system indexed on what look like AOL passwords might be a good model for a re-mappable memory space that allows novel associations.</p>

<p>So how do you modify the search space? How do you add an extra dimension? Well, it depends what you regard as a dimension. And there’s the problem that creating new state spaces to search becomes a state space search for state spaces, at which point I have to confess that there’s no escape. :-) Two schemes for adding dimensions spring to mind. The first is just to encode the entire state space in a one-dimensional array. Extra dimensions become extra slices of the array, which is grown to accomodate them. The other is to take the “a bicycle is seven dimensional object” view and declare the search space’s dimensions to be the combinations of atomic concepts that values can be assigned to. It’s easy to see how to change the dimensions in this scheme, even if to a non-mathematician like me it feels like cheating. :-)</p>

    <p>Dave Bausola recommended “Processing” to me. Processing is the sequel to <a href="http://dbn.media.mit.edu/">DBN</a>, and if you know java or JavaScript/ActionScript you already know it. <a href="http://www.soda.co.uk/members/ed.htm">Ed</a> from <a href="http://www.soda.co.uk/">Soda</a> is using it to write <a href="http://www.sodaplay.com/">moovl</a>, the sequel to <a href="http://www.sodaplay.com/">SodaPlay</a>. <br />
I’ve had it on my hard disk for a while now but I’d not really had a look at it. It took me all of an hour to be writing three-dimensional animations in it this evening. I’ll be converting <a href="/art/cybernetic">The Cybernetic Artwork Nobody Wrote</a> to Processing, and I think I’ll do Ghosts/Subjects using it as well.<br />

    <p><a href="http://www.newscientist.com/">NewScientist</a> is asking whether we all inhabit the same sensory universe (“In The Realm Of Your Senses”, 31/1/04). Yes, that old chestnut. There’s interesting new evidence on genetic variations in the senses such as taste and smell. And of course we learn from our senses, so this may have some bearing on the construction of our self.<br />
But, as NewScientist recognises, once you get the data from your senses you have to process it. And then all bets are off. The processing may vary genetically, or the brain may converge on a coherent and normalised view of the world. <br />
I wouldn’t mind having orange-receptive eye cones, though, which are a very uncommon bit of genetics. I think I have trouble with orange. I can see it, but I’m never convinced I’m seeing what everybody else is seeing. I tend to see a reddy yellow or a yellowy red, very rarely an orange. Maybe it’s just a mental block from one of my tutors accusing me of being colour blind one time when I was using deliberately horrible colours. I can see <a href="http://colorvisiontesting.com/ishihara.htm">the numbers</a>, anyway…</p>
