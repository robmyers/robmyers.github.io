        Back From Tunisia

    <p>I’m back from Tunisia. It’s an excellent place. I filled a sketchbook whilst I was there.</p>

<p>Got lots of rest, lazed around the beach and the hotel pool, went to Soose and Monastir, ate far too much. I didn’t go to the Sahara with Evie and Tom, though.</p>

<p>I’ve come back to find the MacOSX Tiger DR waiting for me and my email inbox limit exceeded (!).</p>

        Masking Paint
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">10 Jul 2004</span>

    <p>One problem I’ve had with using masking tape or airbrush mask film to mask off areas of canvas when painting is that the paint bleeds under the mask. This leads to unsightly blobs and runs along the edge of the masked area, and just looks ugly.<br />
The solution is to paint the unmasked area in the same colour as the area under the mask first. So the same colour bleeds into the same colour and seals the edge of the mask. You may need to do apply two coats of the same colour for thin paint.<br />
You can then paint over this, and the new colour doesn’t bleed. This does build up the paint fairly high with a fairly sharp border, but that can be an interesting effect in itself, and explains what I’ve seen on lots of contemporary painting. :-)</p>

        Kinkade on QVC
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">06 Jul 2004</span>

    <p>Thomas Kinkade was on QVC this evening in the UK. He cam across as insincere, or possibly jet-lagged, or possibly someone who has sold something they love too many times before. I believe he is sincere at some level below subject-matter and above technique. If Jeff Koons can sell ironically to collectors, Kinkade can sell super-sincerely to the masses.<br />
Kinkade’s technique is pre-modern, oriented to pre-calculated effect. Or is that postmodern? He mentioned Millais. I think of Wright of Derby when I see his work, if only because of that cottage on fire. I want to know if Kinkade takes the differing gamuts of oils and inks into account when painting what are in effect masters for reproduction.<br />
There’s lots of satanic imagery that can be found there for the looking: the ghosts in the smoke, the spirits in the waves, the serpents of the bridges and houses. Spooky.<br />
He called the prints “product” at one point then backtracked. Everyone has to sell their work. Kinkade’s inbetween the Diamonique (fake diamond) and non-brand brand cosmetics. <br />
The thing that interested me above all was the effect of the canvas on his prints. It adds visual noise. That noise is like the noise at dusk or when you close your eyes. That quality gave his works that are printed on canvas a curiosly realworld, meditative effect. But oh, as I posted to asethetics-L, the horror…</p>
