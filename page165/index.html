        Four Freedoms After All
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">15 Sep 2006</span>

    <p>What freedoms do people need to work with culture? Or, to phrase the question another way, what human rights exist as a result of the existence of culture?</p>

<p>These freedoms may be disparate. Art may not need the same freedoms as journalism. But different areas of cultural endeavour need access to each other to continue the conversation of culture. Art draws on literature and criticism, and vice versa. Even if one artist may not use advertising imagery another may, or a musician the first artist enjoys listening to (or is inspired by) may. This means that an individual may not benefit from specific instances of use of their work, but will benefit from the general ability to use others’ work. This is not to privilege society over the individual, rather it is to give the individual the broadest general freedom.</p>

<p>The concept of “use” of culture is contentious, and failure to understand it leads to bad conclusions being drawn. Playing a song on your iPod is use. Playing the same song on your guitar, singing the same song in the shower, writing down the lyrics, ripping the song from your iPod to your new MP3 player, using part of the song to illustrate a video and mixing samples from the song into a new composition are all use of the work.</p>

<p>It is important not to privilege “creative” uses of work over “consumer” uses of work. This is important because doing so harms consumers (the vast majority of the population) and it also actually harms “creators”. Creators are consumers too, their education and ongoing production are based on consumption of other work. And their leisure time will consist of consumption like anybody else. There are no creators who are not downstream of other creators, both as creators and consumers.</p>

<p>If we privilege creators over consumers then DRM and NonCommercial restrictions become acceptable. These harm creators directly, by preventing them from using work creatively, and indirectly, by depressing consumption of their work. And they harm consumers as well. Regard creators as a sub-group of consumers, creation as a form of consumption (even if only in the sense that an artist is their own first audience), and this generalisation informs the idea of use.</p>

<p>The boundaries of use that people seem to understand intuitively are those of Fair Use. Artists seem to understand Transformative Fair Use, and I will call the combination of Transformative Fair Use, peer to peer sharing and other modern generalisations of fair use Generalised Fair Use.</p>

<p>It is Generalised Fair Use that makes sharing songs on peer-to-peer networks the same as making tapes for friends. Research shows that kids regard noncommercial copying among friends as acceptible but commercial piracy as unacceptible. Artists often regard using fragments or transformed copies of work as acceptable but wholesale copying as plagiarism. Generalised Fair Use is best captured in a licence by Creative Commons’s Sampling Plus license, written to incorporate the ideas of the band Negativland.</p>

<p>If Generalised Fair Use is the generally held view of the boundaries of cultural use, Richard Stallman’s Four Freedoms are the generally held view of the boundaries of software use, or of the freedom of users of software.</p>

<p>Stallman’s Four Freedoms are broader than Generalised Fair Use, in particular they allow wholesale re-use and commercial copying. If we try to apply the Four Freedoms to culture rather than to software this may seem to clash with intuitive understandings of use of culture. It may seem to be a mis-match. Stallman himself does not advocate the Four Freedoms for all cultural works.</p>

<p>The Four Freedoms can be explained psychologically and historically. They can be seen as Stallman’s attempt to recreate his personal nirvana, the MIT AI Lab of the 1970s. This explanation is not a dismissal. The MIT AI Lab at that time, funded by the Cold War American military, was indeed an ideal model of computer usage. And the Four Freedoms are an ideal expression of the human rights that come into existence with the ready availability of computing machinery, they give the most general freedom to users of computers. There were no human rights before there were humans, and there were no computing freedoms before there were computers. But the historical emergence of a truth does not invalidate that truth.</p>

<p>Fair Use has its problems. Lawrence Lessig describes Fair Use as “the right to hire a lawyer”. Fair use is not experienced as a general right in practice, it varies in its application even between instances of the same use. This is a strong flaw for Fair Use. No rights are certain in practice, but Fair Use is so uncertain, and so dependent on being able to pay for access to legal defence, that it can be a hollow “right”.</p>

<p>The contradictions of Fair Use’s indirect effects make the case for Fair Use as opposed to The Four Freedoms less clear cut. It is possible to make money from copying indirectly under Generalised Fair Use if you are a P2P company or a blank tape manufacturer. You just cannot make money directly. It is possible to copy an entire work. You must simply do so non-commercially or in a form that doesn’t compete with the original.You can copy all of a work non-transformatively in some circumstances. It is rare that Fair Use gives equivalent freedom to the Four Freedoms simultaneously, but this creates more uncertainty and may not restrict other users any more at any given moment.</p>

<p>The Four Freedoms are a superset of Fair Use. Compared to Fair Use they offer clarity and certainty in the form of  a generalised set of rights. They solve every specific problem that “orphan works” protesters, p2p protestors, fair use protestors, and other specific campaigners seek to address. And they solve it not with a long list of exceptions but with a single inclusive strategy.</p>

<p>Opponents of The Four Freedoms for culture generally cite reputation or monetary remuneration as harmful losses to copyleft. These are serious complaints and deserve serious consideration. ND and NC are responses to the potential of such losses. But ND users generally want stronger restrictions than even normal copyright, and have Moral Rights to defend them anyway. To enforce ND effectively would require draconian anti-user technology that cannot be less harmful than any loss of reputation. And NC does not prevent everyone else making money from licenced work. P2P networks and MP3 player manufacturers can profit handsomely from NC work. It is true that other record labels cannot re-sell it. But it is also true that the author cannot compete economically with their own work made available universally at no cost. NC is therefore a hollow victory at best. This is not to say that economic or personality rights are unimportant. It is to say that the way they are approached here is self-defeating and overly harmful to other rights.</p>

<p>The Four Freedoms are not without their problems, but these problems are more subtle than people taking quotes out of context or people not being able to get rich from a novelty single. Alternatives to the Four Freedoms give less general freedom, are unclear or unfair, or are self-contradictory and ineffective despite seeming less harmful in some special cases. The Four Freedoms are the only general enough and powerful enough model of human rights concerned with the freedom to use creations of the mind that we have today. In as much as any discovery of human ethics can be, they are true.</p>

        The Value of Freedom and More Reification
      </a>
    </h1>

    <p><strong>The Value Of Freedom</strong></p>

<p>Tom in the comments raises a question that I will recast as the issue of which “freedoms” are more important. In abstract all freedoms are equally important if we have some concept of human dignity or worth, it is only when these freedoms collide in practice that we should seek to prioritise them. But there is a temptation to regard some freedoms as obviously more important than others, especially in a crisis. The idea of feeding people first then worrying about their freedom seems eminently practical.</p>

<p>Ignoring freedom in the name of immediate need can be counter-productive though, and can be engineered to serve other people’s ends. To take a common example, women’s rights may seem a shibboleth when faced with the need to deal with patriarchal community leaders to feed the starving. But denying women’s rights is immensely harmful to society and the economy in general, never mind to the half of the population they apply to, and may well not lead to everyone getting fed whether today or in the long run. It will serve patriarchal power structures though.</p>

<p>In trying to prioritise freedoms one must be wary of unintended consequences and self-undermining actions if one believes that freedoms have social value. If one believes that freedoms are part of human dignity or absolute in some other way, then again one must be very careful that one’s sentiment does not undermine the very ends one is seeking to achieve, and that it is not exploited to serve the ultimately oppositional and un-free or un-dignified ends of others. And If freedoms are of value in themselves, they may be worth suffering for.</p>

<p><strong>More Reification</strong></p>

<p>The idea of a “commons” is reification. It privileges the objects of human activity over that activity (and humanity). It also leads to calling people “commoners”, which implies a king and a feudal society.</p>

<p>The idea of “Free Software” looks like it again confuses human subjectivity with the products of that subjectivity. It should perhaps be “Hacker Freedom”, and “Free Culture” should be “Cultural Freedom” or “Freedom of Culture”. The latter two may be useful labels to get away from the secondary permission culture of NC anyway. But the principles of Free Software are human freedoms, not “freedom” of the products of human activity. This is another reason why the BSD fanatic view of the world is wrong. Selling the products of human activity is not as important as the freedom to continue that activity.</p>

<p><em>After I commented that sharing did not involved any loss on the part of the sharer, Lessig pointed out that if I share atoms, then there is, in fact, a loss.</em></p>

<p>If Lessig has red atoms and I have blue atoms and we share them we each have access to twice as many atoms as we would otherwise. We can also make purple atoms (or molecules…), which we couldn’t before.</p>

<p>This isn’t a loss unless we very carefully look at sharing as a single act in a single moment undertaken by a single instance of homo economicus, in which case we can make it look like a loss if we really want to (any economic exchange can be presented as a loss in the same way).</p>

    <p>I spent Saturday <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/index.php/Reading">mapping Reading for OSM</a>. This consisted of walking around an estate with a GPS and Matt Lee from <a href="http://www.cnuk.org/">CNUK</a>. We did a depth-first search of the roads, and you can see our trace here in puce (I think it’s puce, I thought it was purple but that doesn’t look right. Tom?):</p>

<p><a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/">OSM</a> is a brilliant project. I must see what needs doing around Peterborough.</p>

<p>Matt and I talked about the need for a Free Culture Foundation, which I think he may be doing something about now, although in a slightly different form.</p>

        Debian, DRM, And Misunderstanding Freedom
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">23 Aug 2006</span>

    <p>Some years before the DMCA became law, Debian filed the serial number off the Free Software Definition, added some confusion, and produced the Debian Free Software Guidelines (DFSG). Over the years the DFSG have suffered bitrot as copyright law and the strategies used to attack freedom have evolved. In particular, the DFSG predate the laws used to support DRM. With the emergence of the Creative Commons licenses, the DFSG have started to cause problems for free licensing, not surprisingly around the issue of DRM.</p>

<p>Debian (or rather Debian Legal) believe that the ability for DRM vendors to impose DRM on users is an important freedom that should not be limited by licenses. This is based on a misunderstanding of clause 3 of the FSD/DFSG and a romanticisation of the nature of DRM.</p>

<p>The misunderstanding of clause 3 (no restriction of where or how work can be used) is a simple one. Taken literally clause 3 means that the GPL is not free because you cannot “use” the code to produce proprietary works. This is the line that BSD apologists take. It is a simple category error. DRM can make copyleft content effectively proprietary and undo the freedoms given by the license if the license on the work does not recognise the existence of DRM. It is illogical to argue that licenses that recognise this possible removal of freedom are restrictive. A society that forbids people from owning slaves is not less free than a society that allows slavery. Restrictions on restrictions on freedom are protections of freedom, not impositions of unfreedom in any meaningful sense.</p>

<p>The romanticisation of DRM comes because Debian Legal are mistakenly viewing DRM as a technology rather than as a strategy of copyright law extension. Computers are a technology, so is the printing press. Their use can be regulated, and indeed this is where we get copyright from. But copyright is hundreds of years old, whereas DRM law, which is an extension of copyright, is recent. Had Debian Legal and the FSF been around in the time of Queen Anne, Debian would have argued against copyleft on the basis that it restricted printing press owners’ right to use their technology as they see fit. DRM is an extension of copyright in law assisted by technological measures. This seems to make it a dog whistle for Debian Legal, who are unable to consider DRM as anything other than software or data, which freedom demands that users be able to modify as they wish. But writing “All Rights Reserved” in a GPL licensed program is simply a modification to a file. It is the legal impact of this act that removes freedom, and so users are disallowed from changing a few bytes of data in a few files in this particular way in order to protect freedom.</p>

<p>DRM is a way of removing users freedom. It is a way of making work proprietary. It is part of the extension of copyright law, but can remove the freedom to use even public domain works. If all it takes to circumvent the DFSG is a code element, I can easily write a shell script to remove the copyright headers from BSD-licensed code. I can even modify the files themselves to do so. Or I could were it not for the fact that BSD-licensed code forbids me from doing so. Which is a restriction on my freedom and so a breach of DFSG 3 which makes the BSD license unfree.</p>

<p>There will be better and worse ways of tackling DRM. Free culture licenses may well not be the place to attempt it. The way CC have done it may well not be the right way. But Debian Legal’s confused and dogmatic argument against the current CC license measures based on a misunderstanding of their own guidelines and of the issue at hand, or confused and emotive pleas to “pragmatism” in favour of pro-DRM zealotry, are not sufficient cause for CC to simply abandon their current measures, or to hastily adopt a dual distribution clause.</p>
