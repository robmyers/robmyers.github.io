        Underlying Aesthetic (Dis)Order
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">12 Nov 2003</span>

    <p>Looking at the image generators in the History Of Computing section of<br />
the Science Museum I was struck by how un-artistic the regular<br />
patterns and well defined forms of harmonic analysers and geometric<br />
pens now look. Their artisticness has gone the way of the string<br />
concorde’s. That regular, predictable structure would once have been<br />
the underlying aesthetic of an ordered world. Now you need something<br />
messier to look like a competent reflection of the (dis)order of<br />
things.</p>

<p>This changed worldview is what is reflected in generativity’s<br />
obsession with randomness. Randomness is a way of choosing things as<br />
surely as linear progression is, but it is a way that now seems more<br />
naturalistic. Randomness is generativity’s perspective: if you’re<br />
going to do it a different way you’re departing from the norm.</p>

<p>But randomness is a mid-20th-century reflection, one that very soon<br />
may look as mannered as the output of a “Spirograph”. It was a<br />
reaction to a set of social conditions that have not held for some<br />
time. And imposing order on randmoness, finding patterns in the noise,<br />
is a connoseurish and distracting activity to impose on the<br />
viewer. More contemporary choice and noise functions are needed, ones<br />
that give the viewer something more interesting to see and to do.</p>

        Snapshot Generativity
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">10 Nov 2003</span>

    <p>“Frieze” ran an article on “Lomography” some time ago, concluding that<br />
however designerish “Lomo” photographers may feel they’re being they<br />
are still producing Lomo-aesthetic images (see<br />
<a href="http://www.lomography.org">http://www.lomography.org</a> for why). But this is true of any<br />
fixed-focus or special-effect camera, from the Box Brownie through<br />
1950s corrective-lens-and-filter cameras, “Polaroids”, 110s,<br />
lenticular print cameras, fixed-lens digital cameras and Lomo’s<br />
multi-lens or coloured-flash cameras. Lomo just try to make it a<br />
virtue.</p>

<p>There’s a name for the self-similar photography of the tourist and the<br />
partygoer: The Snapshot Aesthetic. Partly due to the<br />
would-be-photographer trying to realise pre-existent image models,<br />
partly because of the constraints of the media, things always seem to<br />
come out a certain way in snapshots.</p>

<p>The Snapshot Aesthetic casts its shadows from the platonic realm into<br />
the real world like a brand or a religion, actualised by anyone<br />
without an SLR. It is therefore generative, an engine with input,<br />
output and an aesthetic transformation between the two. Describing The<br />
Snapshot Aesthetic in this way is not an after-the-fact switch of<br />
description and prescription - snapshots are still being taken and are<br />
most likely becoming more like snapshots as time goes on.</p>

<p>This may seem a strangely destructive generativity, one that limits<br />
the space of images rather than extending it. But this is true of any<br />
aesthetic - an aesthetic is a set of constraints on production. The<br />
imposition of constraints limits, but it also directs and<br />
focusses. Infinite choice would take infinite time and have infinitely<br />
dissipate meaning so constraining the choice space is good. Art<br />
without constraints is not possible, but art without knowledge of its<br />
constraints is kitsch.</p>

    <p>The camera is meant to be an objective recorder of optical fact (stop laughing at the back). So the thought of a camera that alters the scene that it is to capture, for example by changing the colour of the light in the scene (and I mean really changing it) seems the opposite of what a camera is meant to be:</p>

<pre><code>[http://shop.lomography.com/colorsplashcamera/](http://shop.lomography.com/colorsplashcamera/)   
</code></pre>

<p>This sort of aesthetic intervention seems somehow generative, in that the technology processes the input to create something new, but it’s a real-world generativity, a generativity before the fact. I want a camera that projects halftones…</p>

        Reform
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">11 Oct 2003</span>

    <p>The reform movements of the late 19th and early 20th centuries<br />
reacted to Industrialisation in two ways. Traditionalist<br />
movements such as Arts &amp; Crafts in Britain sought to reject the<br />
dehumanising lifestyle and low-quality products of industrialisation<br />
and to return to the values and styles of an idealised pre-industrial<br />
past. Progressive movements such as Bauhaus in Germany sought to<br />
embrace the efficient lifestyle and affordable products of<br />
industrialisation in and to move on to an idealised social future. These social<br />
agenda went hand-in-hand with each movements’ aesthetic agenda, each<br />
seeking to improve material and social forms by their intervention.</p>

<p>Post-Industrialism has led to the rise of contemporary reform<br />
movements, similarly concerned with rejecting or embracing the<br />
aesthetic and mode of production of the day.</p>

<p>Anti-globalisation seeks to return the first world to a romanticised<br />
pre-branding past with an aesthetic of genuine, unmediated<br />
first-order experience and social exchange and space whilst bringing<br />
the third world out of poverty. But as offshoring gains pace the<br />
anti-globalisation dream of removing the intrusion of branding into<br />
everyday life and levelling living conditions around the world may be<br />
realised only ironically.</p>

<p>The Open Source movement seeks to alter the ownership and rewards of<br />
technological production and distribution, with anything beyond a<br />
rough and ready functionalist aesthetic undetermined outside of<br />
software development. Open Source is a flexible model that can be<br />
applied to areas outside of software engineering and the media. Anything<br />
that can be designed or distributed can be open sourced, with<br />
competition based on quality of manufacture, delivery or support.</p>

<p>Open Source, then is a model that can and must be applied to the<br />
production of social and aesthetic forms as well as technological<br />
ones. Open Source is a redistribution of capital (or at least value), but<br />
distributed and voluntary rather than centralised and<br />
imposed. How this will look has yet to be decided. Hopefully without a<br />
centralised beaurocracy to impose a “Socialist Realism” or yBA-style kitsch<br />
aesthetic the results will be vital.</p>
