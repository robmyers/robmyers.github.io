    <p>I finally decommissioned my last Mac (an old G4 that dual-booted Debian) and replaced it with a slightly newer PC running <a href="http://trisquel.info/">Trisquel GNU/Linux</a>. Trisquel is a “free as in freedom” distro that takes all the proprietary junk out of the Linux kernel and doesn’t install non-free codecs or plugins for media players and web browsers.</p>

<p>You might think that Trisquel would be limited by privileging freedom over convenience, but no. It Just Worked. Trisquel found not just my audio and graphics cards but my printer and even my Wacom tablet without so much as a nudge. I’ve plugged in a bluetooth dongle and used a Wiimote with it. The only thing I couldn’t get working was the wireless network (I don’t have a wireless dongle with free firmware for it), but it’s a desktop system so I just plugged it into the hub.</p>

<p>If you are looking for a GNU/Linux distro, I recommend Trisquel. I asked my youngest child, and they thought it was better than Mac OS X. You won’t get Flash movies or proprietary hardware drivers, but you do get a truly free operating system. Give it a go.</p>

<p>Wormwoods is a generative sitcom. Go and take a look.</p>

<p>The characters are based on DGRs, Demo Graphic Replicators. DGRs are code bots that search for tweets matching keywords based on factors such as the time of day and their simulated emotional state then retweet them. I wrote the code for the DGRs (inspired by my earlier draw-something and Cybernetic Artworld), and it’s under the AGPL. I’m very pleased to say that the non-retweet cultural part of Wormwoods is under BY-SA. This is all-copyleft culture, and I’m very proud to have helped make it possible. Marcus is writing the posts and comment dialogue for the DGR-based characters on the blog, and Dave has worked tirelessly to make sure that the tools and concepts are in place to make this happen.</p>

<p>Yes, I’m hyping something I have a hand in but I don’t hand out praise lightly. This is really, really good both as culture (I defy you to read it and not smile at least) and as technical and legal systems. When something that you know the behind-the-scenes details of still makes you laugh when you see it, it must be on to something.</p>

    <h2 id="gah-punk">Gah Punk!</h2>

<p>Back in the day I found the name “cyberpunk” utterly cringeworthy. But William Gibson’s sprawl trilogy did do what punk did, which was to aesthetically critique socio-economic conditions through art. Gibson’s Reagonomic future seen through the eyes of those that it chews up and spits out is in its attitude recognisably punk.</p>

<h2 id="colourful-aesthetic-resistance-not-dreary-doctrinal-compliance">Colourful Aesthetic Resistance Not Dreary Doctrinal Compliance</h2>

<p>Steampunk has a BBC4-documentary bourgeois tweeness to it, but it’s important that the neccessary corrective to this doesn’t go too far in the other direction. Steampunk isnot and cannot be pre-or anti-industrial without becoming aesthetically and politically incoherent. Luddism is not the model. Rather in steampunk the technology of industry has gone out into society rather than sucking society into it. It adorns the individual rather than the individual adorning it. It is in the mapping from this fantasy to our peak oil techno-social reality that Steampunk’s critical value lies. Trying to make it more literally and doctirnally political would destroy that criticality.</p>

<h2 id="touched-by-the-hand-of">Touched By The Hand Of…</h2>

<p>Steampunk is a natural complement to Goth. Both are an ironic romantic stance using the aesthetic resources of historic iconography, whether haunted castles or satanic mills. Both involve dressing up and acting out without taking yourself too seriously. And both are an aesthetic resistance to the totalising schemes of society and its opponents. Like Adorno’s critical autonomy of art, youth culture is critical to the extent that it is not literally political. Goth and Steampunk exemplify this. Not Verne or Stoker, but Verne <em>and</em> Sotker!</p>

<h2 id="beware-the-seductive-aesthetics-of-fascism">Beware The Seductive Aesthetics of Fascism</h2>

<p>Some of the Dieselpunk blog posts and photos of costumes I’ve seen recently have started flirting with the aesthetics of mid-20th-century European design. One of the dangers of looking at that time and place from the outside is that people will homogenise it. Which given the division between free and totalitarian states that characterises the period would be a terrible mistake. The machinery and fashion of the fascist states were so aesthetically striking because of what they had to conceal ethically. Don’t make your boots too shiny.</p>

        Free Riders
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">14 Nov 2009</span>

    <p>In economics, a “free rider” is someone who takes value from a public good without giving anything back. They are an economic parasite of the commons. Too many free riders will destroy a public good, denying its value to everyone. This is clearly bad, and should be prevented.</p>

<p>There is an argument that the GPL can be used by companies as a tool to discourage free riders on Free Software projects, but that if you don’t care about punishing free riders you should just use a BSD-style licence instead. This argument is incoherent and suspect.</p>

<p>Free Software is a matter of ethics, not economics. The GPL is an ethical tool, not an economic one. It exists to promote the freedom of individuals to use software, not to prevent the economic exploitation of source code by competitors.</p>

<p>In economic terms, anyone who doesn’t contribute to the production of the code but still uses it is a free rider. This means that any user of the software who does not also hack on it is a free rider. Given that there are many thousands of packages in the average modern free software operating system distribution this means that <em>all</em> users are free riders not just on one project but on many if not all of those that they use.</p>

<p>This is at odds with the idea of Free Software, where freedom is not limited to hackers (or rather their bosses) but is something for all users of software. Saying that free riders are bad mis-characterises the issue as economics not ethics and makes “open source” opposed to user freedom.</p>

<p>Don’t ask whether or how to punish free riders. Ask how to promote individual freedom. It is this individual freedom that the GPL is designed to protect. It isn’t designed to punish free riders. The real free riders are those who wish to benefit from freedom without passing it on. They always prefer non-copyleft licences because those licences don’t require you to respect the freedom of the very software users that free software is for.</p>

        Economic Exploitation and Control vs. Operation and Freedom
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">14 Nov 2009</span>

    <p>Copyleft does not limit the “freedom” of business to “use” resources that would otherwise be restricted by copyright. Organizations do not have freedom, individuals do. Individuals may be members of organizations, freedom of association being an important personal freedom. but their freedom as members of that organization is a product of their personal freedom, not any magical properties of the organization. It is a non-sequitur to claim that the freedom of the organization requires the restriction of the freedom of any individuals, whether within or without that organization.</p>

<p>It is true that copyleft can make economically exploitable resources available to businesses at greatly reduced cost if the economy in which those resources are produced is amenable to doing so. This benefits businesses by reducing their costs. But this is not the intended primary effect of free software, free data and free culture. The intended primary effect is that everyone everywhere always be free to use software, data and cultural works.</p>

<p>“Use” here does not mean “exploit economically”, as in “we’ll use Linux to reduce our operating costs”. That is not use, that is purchasing. “Use” means operation, manipulation, working on, executing, playing, experiencing. The user of the software is the person operating it, not the person paying them.</p>

<p>It might be argued that this is just one definition of freedom and one definition of use. But alternative definitions that try to replace individuals with economics quickly lead to unfreedom. And eventually to demands for control of the public as a pre-requisite for a private enrichment that is privileged for unexamined ideological reasons.</p>

<p>Given that the resources to be used for that private enrichment wouldn’t exist without the freedom to produce and share them, this is cashing out and ultimately self-defeating. To plead that copyleft will prevent a business enriching itself at the expense of society isn’t entrepreneurealism or innovation.</p>

<p>When people say that businesses cannot use copylefted work, they almost always mean that they could do but they refuse to. They believe that the public’s freedom can only come at the expense of private economic privilege. That is a disturbing political position and one that is not borne out by history. There are more millionaires under market capitalism than there were under feudalism, and there are more consumers to enrich them in an open society than in a closed one.</p>

<p>I am opposed to NonCommercial and other discriminatory licences in no small part because they exclude business. I have advised businesses that wish to use copyleft as part of their business plans. I am not anti-business. What I am opposed to is the self-defeating illiberality that lurks behind calls for economic privilege to override social equality.</p>
