    <p><strong>Mars Attacks!</strong></p>

<p>This Tim Burton film with Tom Jones fighting (well, fleeing) early CGI martians made more money in the UK than in America on its first release. It’s knowing kitsch with an enemy that says one thing and does another. Tories will hate the former, Guardianistas will find the latter as incomprehensible in art as they do in real life.</p>

<p><strong>Starship Troopers</strong></p>

<p>An hilarious parody of militarism and media body fascism with amazing aliens and Doogie Howser MD as a Herr Flick lookalike psychic. This tends to out Buffy fans, who hate all the beautiful ubermenchen getting eaten.</p>

<p><strong>Alien 3</strong></p>

<p>This troubled entry in the Alien series divides audiences into those who think it is the worst possible end to the character of Ripley and the whole idea of the Alien series imaginable and those who made the mistake of giving Alien 4 a chance.</p>

<p><strong>Mad Max III</strong></p>

<p>Where did all the corn come from? And where do they get all the food for the pigs?</p>

        The Libre Labyrinth

    <p>The excellent Greg London has a new book on Free Culture and Free Software out:</p>

<p>_I just uploaded a first draft of my new book,<br />
“Libre Labyrinth” to my website.</p>

<p>While working out some issues with what an<br />
Open Hardware license would need to be comparable<br />
to the GNU-GPL, I came up with a Venn Diagram<br />
that describes how copyright, patents, functionality,<br />
DRM, and other concepts can affect a FLOS project.</p>

<p>It turns out that this diagram ends up being a<br />
completely objective way to describe, compare,<br />
and contrast any sort of license, without resorting<br />
to subjective terms such as “Free” or “Libre” or<br />
“Open Source”.</p>

<p>The book also goes into a brief discussion of scalability<br />
of a project, which is independent of the license<br />
you choose for your project. The section on scalability<br />
discusses issues such as Brook’s Law, where it does and<br />
does not apply, parallel versus sequential tasks, and<br />
the amount of overhead added to a project per person added.</p>

<p>It’s about 80 pages and is licensed CC-BY</p>

<p>You can download it here:_</p>

    <blockquote>_It may seem dull, but understanding how a carrot grows is essential to a farmer. Understanding how Photoshop works is not necessary to use it, but to get the best from the system-as-application, knowing more about the under lying code is more important than understanding complementary colours. That's why Rob's Minara is such a smart way to think about the relationship between design and software._  
- [Designing Problems are for the Lazy Â« Zero influence](http://zeroinfluence.wordpress.com/2008/01/02/designing-problems-are-for-the-lazy/)</blockquote>

<p>Dave talks about The Joneses and design in general and kindly mentions <a href="http://minara.sourceforge.net/">Minara</a> along the way. I should point out that despite a tutor’s once confusing my choice of some horribly coloured paper with a choice of horrible colours I do understand complimentary colours OK. It’s orange I have trouble with. ;-)Minara 2 / Minara 0.1 / Orlando is progressing nicely. Common Lisp is a wonderful language to work with.</p>
