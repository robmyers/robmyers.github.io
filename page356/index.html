        Harold Cohen Talk Last Night At The Tate
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">28 Apr 2004</span>

    <p>Harold Cohen gave a good talk, and a good Q&amp;A session afterwards (including fielding questions from Huw Jones from the Landsdowne Centre For Electronic Arts and Dave Bausola from Ixi). I managed to meet Harold and briefly say hello beforehand.</p>

<p>I can’t do justice to the talk in a weblog entry, so it’s fortunate that a video of the talk will soon be online <a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/onlineevents/archive/">here</a>. The talk ranged over Harold Cohen’s introduction to computing, the potential of technology, the artistic demands of expertise and technological innovation in an “idiot-proof” age, the struggle to explain colour to AARON, how AARON’s latest work came about, and more.</p>

<p>AARON’s latest work is painting-based with a wider range of objects, shadows, and more expressive virtual “brushwork” as well as a new palette made possible by its new archival quality large-scale inkjet printer. It’s strange seeing AARON’s plants and other objects without their traditional black outlines, but AARON is now truly painting rather than colouring drawings. I do wonder about “simulating” the layering of opaque colour to be rendered flat by an inkjet printer: this feels different from the physical “proofs” AARON has produced previously, but the results certainly look good and the effect could be achieved with real opaque paint anyway. I think I missed several minutes of the talk just looking at the slides of the new images as they were shown. I’ll need to check that archive myself to see what I missed. :-)</p>

        On “Language”

    <p>(From a discussion on Aesthetics-L)</p>

<p>The existence of a penumbra does not cause light and dark to wink out<br />
of existence. Ordinary language philosophy’s obsession with edge-cases<br />
fills lonely evenings but ignores the break-out strategy of<br />
<em>generating</em> language.</p>

<p>I don’t know what the opposite of bootstrapping is (self-obviating?),<br />
but linguistic arguments regarding the limit of language have an<br />
obvious and fatal flaw, as do attempts to communicate on the limits of<br />
communication…</p>

<p>Most people don’t care how language works. It usually doesn’t fail to<br />
in some way. History and fiction are full of examples of the failure of<br />
language and communication both tragic and amusing, the limit of<br />
language is not a stunning philosophical insight. What is stunning<br />
about philosophy is the failure to get with the program and accept<br />
fuzziness, poetry, or any other continuous, combinatorial idea of<br />
language rather than wallow in late Modernism’s dreary fascination with<br />
pathology and bogus exactitude. Language is not discrete, and if it was<br />
you’d hit Godel anyway. There is a signal in the noise. Get used to the<br />
static, or ironise it into signal like Trip Hop did.</p>

<p>Language (and art) is (potentially) infinite. It is possible to<br />
characterise and show the limits of infinite series (or whatever, you<br />
can work with them anyway), but given that human experience and lives<br />
are finite, this is unlikely to be a serious problem. At worst we have<br />
to accept that meaning is fuzzy and lazily evaluated. Which is<br />
potential, not limit.</p>

<p>If there are no ideas, no concepts, no language and no communication,<br />
or they are broken, or we are deluded in our understanding of how they<br />
work or that they work, something very strange is going on. That would<br />
be an interesting focus for philosophy, and since it involves<br />
appearance(s), aesthetics.</p>

<p>Linguistic enamourment is masturbatory, and linguistic reflexiveness is<br />
historically deconstructable…</p>

    <p>Looking at Bayesian-filter-busting spam email, I had an idea. Train a genetic algorithm to make Markov chains. Train the chain on Project Gutenberg’s philosophical texts. Train a spam filter on the same texts. Then evolve philosophical texts, evaluating them by keeping the ones that the filter catches.<br />
Generative philosophy…</p>

    <p>Inspired by the animators, I’ve taken to using red &amp; blue 0.5mm propellor pencil leads from Pentel along with Staedtler Marsmicro 0.5mms for light sketches, and red, blue &amp; black Sanford Peel-Offs for heavier work. Mirado Black Warriors are good on smooth paper, but I prefer Derwent Sketching pencils for rougher paper (sketchbooks rather than copier).</p>
