        minara And GPL 3
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">05 Aug 2007</span>

    <p>minara uses a few small but very useful utility functions from the ttn-pers-scheme project, which seems to be GPL 2 only with no timescale set for upgrading to GPL 3.</p>

<p>I’ll email the author to ask if the next release will be GPL 3. If so, I will hold off on making minara GPL 3 until then. If not, I will re-implement the functions. I know that’s not very “clean room”, but hopefully it will be OK.</p>

<p>I’m not meant to be doing any more work on minara but I really would like to fix the outstanding bugs and do a 0.0.1a release at some point.</p>

        draw-something Project Plan
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">04 Aug 2007</span>

    <p>Here are my current plans for draw-something. They are subject to change.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Relicence as GPL 3. <strong><em>Done.</em></strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>Ensure that colouring code works properly.
    <ul>
      <li>Check that it matches Cohen’s description.</li>
      <li>Do this in chordinator?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Tune up “Interesting Points” system.
    <ul>
      <li>Make 100 images and try to code away unpleasant features.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finish basic simple &amp; large -&gt; complex &amp; small figure plane system.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Move to more complex “figures &amp; developments” system.</p>
  </li>
  <li>More figure types.
    <ul>
      <li>Currently there are polylines, polygons and hulls.</li>
      <li>Add points, circles, arcs, linesets, circlesets.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Switch to integer maths or at least whole-pixel offsets.
    <ul>
      <li>Error based line drawing?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Relational groups.
    <ul>
      <li>Literal mirror, scale, rotate of core skeleton.</li>
      <li>Conceptual groups e.g. “5 points”, “all same size/area”.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Tagging scheme.
    <ul>
      <li>Tag interesting points to get clusters, relations.</li>
      <li>Tag each development to guide later developments.</li>
      <li>Basic implimenteation e.g. plist of symbols.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>A. Solve presentation problem.<br />
- Do it like current AARON or like Copycat, drawing screen &amp; log screen.<br />
- Ltk seems best bet.<br />
- Dump drawing and commentary as event log to (e.g.) Java based player.</p>

<p>B. Make sketch program &amp; development program &amp; colour program?<br />
- UNIX pipeline.<br />
- Make each component simpler.<br />
- Like Kazushi’s systems.</p>

<p>C. Representational imagery?</p>

<p>D. Pixmap/crop-based system or faster vector-based hit testing? (See 7.)</p>

<p>E. Stop using CVS? Just release tarballs?</p>

    <p>rob-art (including draw-something) is now GPL 3 licenced in SourceForge CVS.</p>

<p>draw-somethng-carbon has been removed due to bitrot and also because I cannot work out how the LLGPL interacts with the GPL. The old version is still available in the older release tarballs, and may even work. ;-)</p>

    <p>Get the GPL 3 licenced version of paintr 0.2 from here:</p>

<p><a href="http://paintr.robmyers.org/paintr_0.2_GPL3.zip">http://paintr.robmyers.org/paintr_0.2_GPL3.zip</a></p>

<p>rob-art (including draw-something) and minara will follow assuming that there are no problems with any of the libraries I have used. In particular I will probably have to retire the Carbon version of draw-something (which has severe bitrot anyway).</p>

        Copyleft And Marxism
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">30 Jul 2007</span>

    <p>I am a militant liberal, possibly a socialist libertarian. My political motto is “beware teleology”, so I regard pluralism as the least worst option for society given what happens when societies fall under ideological closures. Including Neoliberalism. Pluralism has come to be the basis of my ongoing interest in copyleft. I believe it strongly supports pluralism. I am nonetheless not delusional regarding the scope and socioeconomic effects of copyleft. It is not a panacea, and I think that Negativland’s Expanded Fair Use might be a better baseline for creative freedom in bourgeois capitalist society were it not for the practicalities.</p>

<p>My research over the last few years has only strengthened my regard for Stallmanism. This research has taken me through venture capitalism, the economics of Web 2.0, neoliberal ethics, the history of the enclosure and allotment movements, the levellers and diggers, 1968 in France, LIP self-management, various anarchist texts, the production of Classical Greek pottery, the history of collectives and LETS schemes, and all sorts of other historical and sociopolitical/economic moments. Oh and Lessig’s writing and that of Isaiah Berlin and of Mackenzie Wark. I have maintained my interest in copyleft not due to doctrinal monomania but to being unable to find anything better given current historical conditions.</p>

<p>I’m writing this to try to gather my thoughts prior to responding to someone who has objected to my criticism of their essay. They have accused me of regarding copyleft as perfect and immutable and believing that anyone who doesn’t share this opinion just needs to read the right books. I have taken several days to consider this and have come to the conclusion that my position will be practically indiscernible from that position for them, but that this is a mischaracterisation of what I believe.</p>

<p>I do believe that copyleft will support the ends of socialists  and marxists within society better than a licensing scheme that seeks to refuse “the commons” to “capitalist exploitation of wage labour”. I believe this because of my long consideration of the self-defeating effects of the Non-Commercial Creative Commons Licence and other discriminatory licenses, and because I don’t believe that capital is stupid enough not to start selling picks and shovels to the workers who will be the only permitted users of such a licence if one is ever written.</p>

<p>I also believe that there is probably some interest for marxist students of the property question in essays titled “Why Software Should Not Have Owners” and “Did You Say Intellectual Property? It’s A Seductive Mirage”.</p>

<p>But I am interested to hear if any of my more marxisant readers think I am talking bollocks, and if so exactly why. Anyone?</p>
