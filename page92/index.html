    <p>Duchamp’s readymades are acts of ontological transubstantiation, they nominate non-artistic objects as artworks. This is aesthetic blasphemy.</p>

<p>Nominating a non-art object as an artwork requires that the object not be an art object. But imagine that you have a time machine. Now you can go back in time to ancient Rome or Greece with any non-art object the artist seeks to nominate as an artwork and have it accepted as a work of art. Not declared, displayed and accepted.</p>

<p>Assuming you avoid paradoxes, the object will not have been nominated as an art object and will never have been a non-art object. Is this just nomination at an extra level of indirection, or does it undo the readymade?</p>

    <p>In 1976 Tom Waits sang “Tom Traubert’s Blues”.</p>

<p>In 1992 he sang “I Don’t Want To Grow Up”.</p>

<p>Each is equivalent given its environment.</p>

    <p>Dealing with a last-chance careerist nonentity and their agenda generates neither light nor heat. There’s a shuffling embarrassment and gazing into your glass that results from being faced with a cretin riding out. When said lackwit also persistently misrepresents what you are saying (or is too incompetent to stump for a clue), giving them the oxygen of google juice is an own goal.</p>

<p>I like blog art and group blogs. I would go to bat for them. I don’t like semiowankery or art-historical overbidding or chin-stroking, ladder-climbing, self-regarding idiots who don’t know the genealogy of Claris Works. Of the two principles, the latter is the stronger.</p>

<p>British libel law, eh? What can you do.</p>

    <p><em>The bloggers and surf clubs discussed at the Net Aesthetics 2.0 panel follow a similar model. But instead of stoically re-creating the art world online, they are opening themselves to a galaxy of experience that could potentially be considered art, while at the same time subversively slipping in their own content.</em><br />
- Tom Moody.</p>

<p><em>The solution to The Institutional Theory Of Art is to recognize artworks as members of the artworld</em>. - Rob Myers.</p>

<p><em>we would agree that the opacity of the aesthetic offers some much needed resistance to the kinds of transparency increasingly demanded in so-called “knowledge work”</em> - Art &amp; Language.</p>
