        Like That

    <p>“Like That” turned into a code generation project but I think this was more trouble than it was worth. Beware the seduction of time-saving code that doesn’t save time. I took the “make a large number of exhibitable works” part and missed out the “quickly” part. And I ended up having to exercise editorial control, and Processing isn’t the right environment for it, and it didn’t make doing the hard things any easier, and so I got discouraged.</p>

<p>So I’m going to roll back “Like That” to the hand-written works, re-make some of the more interesting generated works, and try to push on into the areas I wanted to go but that the code generator made difficult to do.</p>

<p>Now I just need to rescue that work and put it back on the restored web site…</p>

<blockquote>_There's a very fundamental problem facing many content creators in Virtual Worlds these days (such as Second Life™, IMVU™ and others), and that is the problem of Piracy - where one unscrupulous individual takes content from a designer or developer, and then attempts to resell it as their own.  
  
It's a problem - no-one can deny that, but the solution to the problem is not 'deep' DRM. There are a few reasons for this, especially when it comes to content_</blockquote>

<p>Some good (and familiar ;-) ) suggestions for real solutions as well.</p>

    <p>I’m working on reviews for <a href="http://furtherfield.org/">Furtherfield</a>, having long conversations about digital art on Rhizome, reading William Gibson, and learning Rails, Open Inventor and Second Life.</p>

<p>I’m also hacking on some data visualization code (you’ve seen the patterns on this blog) but I’m not sure whether that’s going anywhere. I think 1968/1969 may be my ultimate statement on data visualization. They have the critical distance and irony that a straight piece of data visualization lacks, whatever its input.</p>

<p>Like That is struggling to break through the Processing barrier. I can’t think of a language that Like That would be easy in, but it certainly isn’t Processing. Maybe I can switch to JavaScript or OpenFrameworks. I’ve sworn to just use whatever tools do the job at the time, so I’m looking at OpenSim, but when there are no good tools that doesn’t help.</p>

<p>I need a project that I can just do.</p>
