        Free Licencing For Art
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">29 Sep 2011</span>

    <p>Free Culture is primarily a synonym for free speech. In art, free speech is generally referred to as free expression. Artists face limits on their freedom of expression from various laws that limit their freedom to depict the visual environment, notably copyright law and trademark law. A successful strategy for tackling the restrictions of copyright on computer programming has been the use of “copyleft” licences that ironize copyright law in order to promote rather than restrict individuals’ freedom to use and adapt copyrighted materials.</p>

<p>Copyleft protects the freedom to use any materials that it covers wherever an individual may encounter them. It is inalienable and indivisible freedom. Weakening copyleft weakens this, and doing so should only be considered as a tactical last option.</p>

<p>Legal documents such as licences, however simple, can always have unintended consequences. Copyright law is complex and licences should always be drafted by lawyers familiar with the area. But this isn’t to say that alternative copyright licences should be motivated by lawyers or simply follow the faultlines of copyright law. They should be expressions of principle made rigorous and enforcible.</p>

<p>Software copyleft licences are tailored to the demands of writing and using software. But software is very different from other media covered by copyright, so this does not mean that other artifacts covered by copyright should have their own medium-specific licences. Culture is a dialogue, and much contemporary culture (including much contemporary art) is multi-media, or is adapted from or refers to work created in other media. A single-medium cultural licence would limit freedom of expression rather than protect the coherence of the medium.</p>

<p>It is possible to use non-copyleft “permissive” alternative copyright licences as a means of making irrational economic gifts of works to other individuals. The use of these gifts may support an individual’s freedom of speech. But this does not protect freedom of speech in general as the work they create using those resources need not be licenced to respect the freedom of its audience in return. Copyleft therefore protects freedom of speech more generally than permissive licencing.</p>

<p>Given all this, the licence that I believe should be used by individuals committed to artistic freedom of expression is a legally drafted general-purpose copyleft licence for cultural works. This excludes software licences (like the GPL), documentation licences (like the GFDL), and non-copyleft cultural works licences (like CC-BY and CC-NC-SA). It also, for reasons I will explain, excludes the FAL.</p>

        Collaboration and Freedom - The World of Free and Open Source Art
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">21 Sep 2011</span>

    <p>A collection of artworks, texts and resources about freedom and openness in the arts, in the age of the Internet. Freedom to collaborate - to use, modify and redistribute ideas, artworks, experiences, media and tools. Openness to the ideas and contributions of others, and new ways of organising and making decisions together.</p>

<p>This non exhaustive collection is intended to inspire, inform and enable people to apply peer-to-peer principles for making things and getting organised together. We hope that all art lovers, makers, thinkers, organisers and strategists will find something for them from this set of imaginative, communitarian and dynamic contemporary practices.</p>

<p>Curated by Furtherfield: Ruth Catlow and Marc Garrett with additional texts by Charlotte Frost and Rob Myers.</p>

<p>Furtherfield commission ‘Balloon Dog’ by Rob Myers.</p>

<p>A downloadable freely licensed 3D model of an artwork to print and remix. 2011 Furtherfield commission.</p>

<p>Balloon Dog forms part of a series of shareable DIY ‘readymades’ for an era of digital copying and sharing. Iconic objects from the history of appropriation and remixing art are recreated as 3D-digital models. Users can then download and send the digital model to 3D printers via the Internet to receive their own physical artwork through the post at a scale of their choosing.</p>

    <p>ImagePlot is out:</p>

<p><a href="http://lab.softwarestudies.com/2011/09/introducing-imageplot-software-explore.html">http://lab.softwarestudies.com/2011/09/introducing-imageplot-software-explore.html</a></p>

<p>It’s a JImage macro that plots visualizations of image statistics using the images themselves. It’s very cool, do take a look. As well as the complete software under the GPL (but version 2 only???) it has sample data, and essays explaining the project. There are some great examples of visualizations created using the system at the link above.</p>

<p>As what will be the basis of the next posts in my “Exploring Art Data” series, I’ve implemented a simpler version of ImagePlot in R over the weekend. The code to extract image data has been wrapped up as a command-line tool, the code to produce the final visualizations hasn’t.</p>

<p>You can get my code here in the image-analysis folder (it’s GPLv3 or later):</p>

<p>[https://gitorious.org/robmyers/art-data/</p>

<p>](https://gitorious.org/robmyers/art-data/)Here’s an example plot using the Mondrian images from ImagePlot’s sample folder:</p>

<p><a href="/assets_c/2011/09/r_image-57.html"><img src="/assets_c/2011/09/r_image-thumb-400x313-57.png" alt="Mondrian Visualization" /></a>You can create PDF and PNG files as well as view the results onscreen. I want to tweak the display parameters and tidy up a few lines in the code then make a command-line interface for it. And maybe even a GUI interface…</p>

    <p><img src="/IMG_20110914_213645.jpg" alt="IMG_20110914_213645.jpg" />I’ve finished the armature (hand sewn as I don’t have a sewing machine), added a connector so the display can be removed from the main circuit, and boxed up the main circuit.</p>

<p>There have been two problems so far:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The vibration motors really upset the compass module. So the code now turns them off before taking a compass reading. This means that the motors now pulse a couple of times a second. If it was an intentional part of the design it would be quite good</li>
  <li>There’s a problem with the circuit. The first and last motors on the display intermittently get low power and so don’t run. I’m investigating that at the moment (you can see the multimeter probes at the edge of the picture) and hope to have it fixed shortly.
Once I’ve fixed the second problem it’s ready to go…</li>
