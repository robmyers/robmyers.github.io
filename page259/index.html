    <p>Saul mentions Community Arts in one essay. WtK are Community Arts? Must research…</p>

        LETS, Cultural Value, and Remix Reading
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">08 Aug 2005</span>

    <p><a href="http://www.letslinkuk.net/">LETS</a>, Local Exchange Trading Schemes, are local money systems. They aim to keep value within the local community by using a kind of labour barter system.</p>

<p>The very strength of LETS, that they are local schemes, works against them in a globalised society. Local value cannot compete with global value, indeed it is ghettoising.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.remixreading.org/">Remix * </a> is an organisation that is working to create projects across the UK to help people share culture. These are local projects, such as Remix Reading or Remix Brighton. The cultural value of each project is identified locally. But the cultural value of each project is made globally available, through the internet, under <a href="http://www.creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> licenses. Remix *’s local focus contrasts with other Creative Commons projects such as <a href="http://www.ourmedia.org/">OurMedia</a>, which rely on a globally distributed community to provide large volumes of “content”.</p>

<p>Like LETS, the Remix * projects are locally targeted and keep existing value in the local community. Unlike LETS, the Remix * projects allow both global use and global return of value through the Internet, assuming the local contributors use the copyleft ‘SA’ license.</p>

<p>LETS, like Remix *, are a kind of gift economy. This stretches the definition of a gift economy, but it is true at least trivially; money is not exchanged, only the promise of a return of labour or culture. For LETS this promise is quantified, for Remix * it is</p>

<p>The Remix * projects therefore take the best of LETS, capturing local value and building local community, and add the potential of the internet, global building of reputation and sharing of value. Each seems appropriate to the age that spawned them, the post-industrial 1980s for LETS, and the post-dot-com 2000s for Remix *.</p>

    <p>Saul runs the <a href="http://twenteenthcentury.com/uo/index.php/">University of Openness</a>.</p>

<p>He applied Open Source ideas to art very early on:</p>

<p><a href="http://chinabone.lth.bclub.org.uk/~saul/docs/mirrors/saul/os.htm">Open Source and Collective Art Practice</a></p>

<p>And thought generative art through in an art history context, which isn’t done anywhere near often enough:</p>

<p><a href="http://chinabone.lth.bclub.org.uk/~saul/docs/mirrors/saul/artware.htm">Artware</a></p>

<p>I met Saul at Ways of Working Two where he was running a UO workshop, which was cool.</p>

    <p>Banksy’s current “manifesto” is a moving-if-true (Banksy’s site is the only place on the web with any mention of this story) account of absurdist aesthetic intervention bringing humanity to a liberated death camp:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.banksy.co.uk/manifesto/index.html">http://www.banksy.co.uk/manifesto/index.html</a></p>

<p>And his current project is decorating the Israeli wall along inside occupied territories:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/arts/gallery/0,8542,1543331,00.html">http://www.guardian.co.uk/arts/gallery/0,8542,1543331,00.html</a></p>

<p>I hope this isn’t the kind of bogus, lazy, ahistorical moral equivalency that is all too prevalent in the British chatterati regarding the illegal wall.</p>

    <p><strong>Trailer for the next Harry Potter Film.</strong></p>

<p>”…you must choose between what is right, and what is easy.” - Dumbledore to Harry.</p>

<p><strong>Charlie &amp; The Chocolate Factory.</strong></p>

<p>Charlie regards Veruca getting the ticket by her father buying tens of thousands of bars and getting his workers to open them all as unfair. Mike Teevee just hacks Wonka’s numeric system to predict where to find a ticket.</p>

<p>“Only a dummy would give this up for something as common as money” - Grandpa George, regarding Charlie’s one of the five golden tickets.</p>

<p>Willy Wonka is an IP maximalist. he fires all his workers because of industrial espionage and replaces them with a tribe of servile addicts, who at least won’t go to the competition. :-)</p>

<p>“Why is everything so pointless?” - Mike Teevee, unimpressed by the factory.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t have to have a point, that’s why it’s candy!” - Charlie.</p>

<p>Imagine releasing everlasting gobstoppers onto the market. The displacement! :-)</p>

<p>Someone once told me about how they thought they could get the food out of the telly as a child living in a council house. The scene with the TV chocolate hasn’t seemed so funny since then.</p>
