        A Sequel To Grey Tuesday

    <span class="post-date">02 Dec 2005</span>

    <p><a href="http://www.americanedit.org/">Dean Gray Tuesday</a></p>

<p>_Only 10 days after its release, the mash-up album American Edit, which pays tribute to the acclaimed Green Day album American Idiot through some of the best mash-up productions of 2005, was shut down reportedly after received a cease &amp; desist order from Green Day’s label, Warner records, despite the fact that it was released as an internet only release with no commercial gain for the team of mash-up artists involved. […]<br />
_</p>

<p>We hope to mobilize the online Mash-Up community by organizing a simple one-day organized event. Participants would be asked to post the American Edit album online for 24 hours only starting on Tuesday, December 13, at 12:00AM. Doing so is not intended to be a mass organization of music piracy but, rather, one single display of the consumptive power of the mash-up and home remix community in the hopes of encouraging the labels, publishers and artists who are curious about the mash-up community to consider giving the high quality productions of “illegitimate” music a legitimate consideration as a promotional avenue for all music.</p>

    <span class="post-date">02 Dec 2005</span>

    <p>_Copyright maximalists like to contrast copyright with the old system of patronage, when you could only make art if you could convince the Pope or a duke or a king that your art was worthy. Patronage really distorted creative expression, and copyright did indeed promise to decentralize authority over what kind of art was permitted.<br />
_</p>

<p>But the EMI rep’s answer to the Grey Album is patronage. “You must not make this art unless we permit it.” If you work for one of a few big record companies, you can use their legal apparatus to clear the material you want to use in a mashup. Otherwise, your art is illegal and will be censored.</p>

    <p>Second Life allows you to set a “non-transferrable” flag on objects. This means that if someone buys the object they cannot then re-sell it.</p>

<p>In the real world you can re-sell things that you buy. It’s only with the event of software and digital media that companies are trying to get around this with end-user licenses and DRM.</p>

<p>As <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,3604,1646125,00.html">this Guardian article</a> argues, if companies want to sell you songs that evaporate when you stop paying for them, the companies should be willing to accept money that evaporates when they stop giving you access to the music you have paid for.</p>

<p>And it should be the same for Second Life. So I propose Noney. Noney is like money, only not transferrable. If someone sells you an object and insists on making it non-transferrable, they should be willing to accept payment on the same basis.</p>

<p>Anyone who isn’t a hypocrite and who asks for <em>n</em> Linden Dollars payment for something non transferrable will gladly accept <em>n</em> Nonies. They can have as much Noney as they like, but they cannot transfer it, only destroy it when they get tired of it or decide they are fed up with it.</p>

<p>Just need to upload various denomination textures and script the notes. Or possiby a gift voucher. :-)</p>

    <p><a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5700">iCommons is being launched</a> as an international focus for commons activism:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.icommons.org/">http://www.icommons.org/</a> (link not yet live)</p>

<p>And cc.com is being launched as a way for artists to make money from their cc-licensed work.</p>

<p>(Updated: CC.com is a concept, not a URL. Thanks Mike! )</p>

<p>Given all this good stuff, now is a good time to help CC reach their sponsorship target for this year:</p>

        Magnatune: Less Evil Than Sony

    <p>A freeloader complains about Magnatune introducing a nagware policy for their noncommercial offerings:</p>

<p><a href="http://business.newsforge.com/business/05/11/16/1458249.shtml?tid=33&amp;tid=132">Magnatune: We’re not as evil as we could be</a></p>

<p>If you don’t want a company to introduce nagware, buy their products once in a while.</p>

<p>Magnatune show either great chutzpah or the negative effects of speed reading by misrepresenting Lessig and Stallman to claim that noncommercial nagware is helping to build the commons:</p>

<p><a href="http://business.newsforge.com/comments.pl?sid=51682&amp;cid=120141">Magnatune’s thoughts on the article</a></p>

<p>Ugh.</p>

<p>There are many fine copyleft record labels who are building a real cultural commons. <a href="http://www.locarecords.com/">Loca</a> and <a href="http://www.opsound.org/">OpSound</a> for example.</p>
