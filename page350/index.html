    <p>An excellent article on why DRM (Digital Rights Management) is bad for consumers, artists, and companies (via SlashDot):</p>

<p>This was delivered as a lecture to Microsoft! We’re an Apple household (Macs and iPods), but if Steve Jobs can’t apply himself to finding a way that both Apple and Pixar can make money from the network without selling my computer to the MPAA out from under me, it’s going to be Linux time.</p>

    <p>Ken Brown’s efforts on behalf of Microsoft have shifted to creating new terminology for proprietary software vendors to use and trying to change the meanings of words. Ken wants to change “Open Source” to mean asset-stripping (BSD) licenses, which for him means that value-creation licenses (GPL) become -shudder- “Hybrid Source”.</p>

<p>It’s Newspeak, and for a good example of a “Hybrid Source” project of mixed Open Source (BSD) and proprietary code, look no further than Windows. Its networking code was shown to have come from BSD. Yes, the world’s most successful proprietary software is “Hybrid Source”. Which Ken Brown says destroys the value of intellectual property and should be shunned by government.</p>

<p>On the plus side, obviously Microsoft’s new best friend Sun can’t use an evil, hybrid-source license like the GPL for Solaris and Java. They’ll have to use an asset-stripping license, which will allow other proprietary software vendors (such as Microsoft) to cherry-pick their code. But at least they won’t see the reduction in value of their intellectual property that they would if they went GPL. Um…</p>

    <p>UK Arts Minister questions artistic instrumentalism:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/arts/features/story/0,11710,1226951,00.html">Story at Guardian Online.</a></p>

<p>Instrumentalism has distorted perception and funding of art in the UK, giving rise to an aesthetic of access and trivialising art in the process.</p>

<p>The essay’s available here online. Click here for more information.</p>

    <p>Michaelangelo is the latest victim of Asperger’s Syndrome Syndrome. This is where a publicity hungry psychiatric hack assigns a pathology to someone famous using the famous bullet-point-comparison test.</p>

<p>Hopefully some day a cure will be found for the poor individuals who suffer from this syndrome syndrome. Or perhaps we’ll find that their inexplicable drive to pathologise notable historical figures is a result of their work, not a mental disorder, however much it might look that way when you reduce it to a soundbite.</p>
