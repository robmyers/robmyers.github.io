        Sharecropping And Entryism
      </a>
    </h1>

    <p>Any successful movement or cause will attract those that cannot generate their own social capital. Free Software and Free Culture are no exception. From a right-wing ultra-corporate position comes the threat of sharecropping. From a left-wing paleo-marxist position comes the threat of entryism. Both threaten the value of Free Culture to society as a whole and thereby to themselves.</p>

<p>The value of Free Culture is realised through participation. I have helped organizations ranging from a Fortune 100 company to a local community group to participate in Free Culture. I have done this because I believe that all will add value to and benefit from the value of Free Culture.</p>

<p>For this benefit to be gained, we must participate equally as part of a pluralistic society. Trying to gain an advantage by imposing a teleology on others, by instrumentalizing the actions of others, or by selectively excluding others is not participation. It is coercion.</p>

<p>Such coercion destroys the value of a project not only to society as a whole but to those who organize the project because it reduces participation and downstream value. It breaks the irony of copyleft. It is self defeating.</p>

<p>Entryism, a term I am borrowing from leftist polemic, tries to instrumentalise Free Culture as part of the class struggle or against Empire. It tries to take over a more successful project and impose its own concerns on that project. Since this is coercion it will be self defeating. It will therefore damage both the cause of Free Software and whatever cause the groupuscule that attempts it has other than publicity.</p>

<p>Sharecropping, a term popularised by Lawrence Lessig, tries to instrumentalise Free Culture as part of a project of corporate wealth creation. Far too much of Web 2.0 falls under this category. Any project with terms and conditions that give the project organizer unlimited use of your work, or any NC-based corporate project, is sharecropping. Since this is coercion it will be self defeating. Sharecropping usually has a larger advertising budget than entryism so this will take longer to become apparent.</p>

<p>I am not arguing against capitalists or socialists (or whoever) being involved either in the practice of Free culture or in the debates around it. Far from it. I believe that this broad involvement is what makes Free Culture valuable. What I am arguing is that the readymade ideological idees fixes of both neoliberalism and paleo-marxism are not necessarily effective substitutes for the practical solutions of Free Culture and Free Software <em>judged by the terms of those ideologies</em>.</p>

        The No-Derivatives Clause & Immutable Sections: A False Sense Of Security
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">16 Aug 2007</span>

    <p>The No-Derivatives Creative Commons licence module and the GNU FDL’s Immutable Sections appear to allow the circulation of works of opinion or expression while restricting the ability of malicious parties to misrepresent them. For political, polemical or confessional works it is clearly important not only to the author but to society that these works not be misrepresented.</p>

<p>It is not however clear that restrictive licences do more good than harm as a means to this end. There are already social and legal measures in place to prevent the misrepresentation of works. And restrictive licences harm the ability both to propagate and critique the works.</p>

<p>Socially there are strong social norms against plagiarism, falsification of results or quotes, misattribution of works and opinions, or misrepresentation of views or data. There is also an expectation of a right of reply and a right to corrections to breaches of these norms in most media. These rights may be enforced by industry bodies or by government agencies.</p>

<p>Legally there are laws against passing off of goods, laws preventing misattribution under the moral right of Paternity, laws against the mistreatment of works under the moral right of Integrity, laws against libel or slander, and laws protecting “personality rights”.</p>

<p>Within Free Software and Free Culture there are also licence requirements that protect against misattribution. Misattribution is arguably the core issue of misrepresentation of works. The GNU FDL and the CC licences require that derivative versions be clearly marked, and neither Debian nor The OSI regard this as a limit on freedom.</p>

<p>People and organizations do publish the results of breaking these norms, laws and licenses. Some do so illegally but there are also specific social and legal cases where this is allowed and even necessary.</p>

<p>Socially the practices of parody, satire, critique and debate all require use of the work that the author may not agree with. This use may involve quotation, wholesale use, transformative use or untransformed recontextualization.</p>

<p>Legally these social practices are encoded in exceptions to copyright such as Fair Use or Fair Dealing. Both the new GNU GPL 3 and the CC licences explicitly state their support for Fair Use. The GNU FDL should as well.</p>

<p>Using Fair Use and even minor rhetorical skill a malicious commentator can easily use context and selective quotation to argue that an author’s position is the opposite of the one that they actually hold. Placing a work under a restrictive licence does not prevent this. It simply gives a false sense of security to the author. And it allows malicious authors to chill public comment on their work through timewasting with meritless accusations of licence breaches. The net result is a loss for freedom of speech and no real gain for the protection of the reputation of the author.</p>

<p>It is better both for the author and for society to protect the right of reply with a copyleft licence or an expanded fair use licence than to try to suppress it with a restrictive licence. The social, legal and licencing effects are already stronger and more subtle than a restrictive licence, and such a licence cannot protect against misrepresentation any more than society, the law, and existing copyleft licences already do anyway.</p>

        Lonely Werewolf Girl

    <span class="post-date">14 Aug 2007</span>

    <p>I’ve read and watched an awful lot of very bad werewolf stories over the years. I think the absolute worst was the episode of “Journey To The Bottom Of The Sea” where - actually it’s so bad I’m not even going to tell you. But at least it didn’t have the obsession with human squalor and misery that the likes of Alice Borchardt and S. P. Somtow inflict on page after page of for-the-love-of-god-get-on-with-it filler while failing to find anything to say or do with their characters.</p>

<p>I mention this only to plead that I am not entirely a drooling lycanthropy fanboy despite the fact that I am here to express how very wonderful I think Martin Millar’s (“Lux &amp; Alby”, etc.) new novel “<a href="http://www.lonelywerewolfgirl.com/">Lonely Werewolf Girl</a>” is. Yes, that’s the title. Yes, that’s the cover. And, yes, the author does mention “Buffy The Vampire Slayer” as an inspiration in interviews. If these things appeal to you then great. If they don’t, and they didn’t to me, don’t let them put you off. It’s brilliant.</p>

<p><em>Dawn is on an all-out charm offensive</em></p>

<p>This is brilliant for two reasons.</p>

<p>Firstly, this must be how gaming looks to non-gamers.</p>

<p>Secondly, this is how non-gamers look to gamers when they try to join in.</p>

<p>It’s a full spectrum parody. ;-)</p>

    <p>Cover by ROMAN DIRGE. Story by ROMAN DIRGE.</p>

<p>Interior art by mistake. It looks like someone has just discovered the airbrush tool in Photoshop. “Hey! Let’s smear indistinct greys around with no regard for light sources, shapes, textures or different brush sizes!” It is embarrassingly bad art. No, it’s not atmospheric. Not unless the atmosphere smells strongly of methane.</p>

<p>But the cover and pre-order sheets say ROMAN DIRGE. Not REMEDIAL PHOTOSHOP AIRBRUSH STUDENT. ROMAN DIRGE.</p>

<p>So it’ll sell a few copies and piss a lot of people off. Including any comic shop owners who feel they’ve been mis-sold the damn thing when it turns up in this week’s orders.</p>

<p>If this was a media blog I’d now produce some profound insight into how this is an example of how not to squander the relational capital that artists build up with their audience. But it isn’t, so I won’t.</p>
