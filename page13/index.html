Halfway through I realised that by changing each description into a standard format, I could write code to parse the descriptions and analyse them to help me find those themes and commonalities. So I did. The code is in R and it’s available here:</td>

<p>The code loads various modules, parses the file and constructs a corpus and matrix from the words in each review. It then outputs various statistics and graphs regarding them.</p>

<p>First up, which terms do I use most frequently, ten or more times:</p>

<pre><code> [1] "animated" "bill"     "dollar"   "euro"     "glitched" "image"   
 [7] "mapped"   "show"     "texture"  "video"
</code></pre>

<p>The most popular subjects are dollar and Euro bills. Art about them shows something about them. It does so using video, animations (whether video, Flash, or HTML5), images, glitch and texture mapping.</p>

<p>Terms I use five or more times:</p>

<pre><code> [1] "aesthetic"  "animated"   "art"        "background" "banknotes" 
 [6] "bill"       "collage"    "colour"     "dollar"     "economic"  
[11] "euro"       "flag"       "gif"        "glitched"   "graphic"   
[16] "hundred"    "image"      "loop"       "makes"      "mapped"    
[21] "money"      "note"       "piece"      "rendering"  "show"      
[26] "texture"    "video"      "words"
</code></pre>

<p>Flags and words join the subjects, hundred unit notes are the most popular, looped animated GIFs, collages and graphics join the forms and figure/ground relations are there with mention of “background”.</p>

<p>Finally let’s look at words I use three or more times:</p>

<pre><code> [1] "abstract"    "aesthetic"   "album"       "allow"       "american"   
 [6] "animated"    "apparently"  "application" "art"         "background" 
[11] "banknotes"   "bill"        "black"       "blue"        "changing"   
[16] "classic"     "collage"     "colour"      "composite"   "depicted"   
[21] "direct"      "dollar"      "economic"    "effective"   "euro"       
[26] "facebook"    "flag"        "flickering"  "frame"       "gif"        
[31] "glitched"    "google"      "graphic"     "grid"        "html5"      
[36] "hundred"     "image"       "landscape"   "like"        "link"       
[41] "loop"        "love"        "makes"       "mapped"      "million"    
[46] "money"       "monochrome"  "morphing"    "new"         "note"       
[51] "one"         "page"        "patterns"    "piece"       "pixelart"   
[56] "playing"     "polygons"    "possibly"    "price"       "rendering"  
[61] "screen"      "show"        "signs"       "sites"       "stack"      
[66] "style"       "texture"     "time"        "use"         "video"      
[71] "virtual"     "web"         "white"       "words"       "work"       
[76] "yellow"      "zoomed"
</code></pre>

<p>No surprises there, except possibly “love”. The code will confuse “Euro” and “European”, so that’s why the US is mentioned but not Europe. Facebook and Google add corporations to the subjects. Colours are added to the formal properties: yellow, blue, white, black. Landscape joins the subjects. And works play, are direct, are classic, have style, an aesthetic, a price, are new. And I weasel about them with “possibly”.</p>

<p>Next lets look at the associations between words. First some obvious ones.</p>

<p>Money:</p>

<pre><code>google           love          1990s            age        ambient 
  0.65           0.59           0.43           0.43           0.43
</code></pre>

<p>Art:</p>

<pre><code>corrupted     miscoloured         nothing          purest            rows 
     0.75            0.75            0.75            0.75            0.75 
   street            look            much           piece         classic 
     0.75            0.52            0.52            0.48            0.41 
</code></pre>

<p>Net:</p>

<pre><code>carefully    contract   described        form        sale    specific 
     1.00        1.00        1.00        1.00        1.00        1.00 
  another application       price       piece         art 
     0.70        0.49        0.44        0.43        0.36
</code></pre>

<p>The corruption found in association with art here is aesthetic, thanks to glitch art.</p>

<p>The word cloud in the next section has some stand-out words. We can look at their associations as well to follow suggestions from within the data.</p>

<p>Dollar:</p>

<pre><code>bill                         1950s 
0.87                          0.33
</code></pre>

<p>Video:</p>

<pre><code>vimeo     amateur      batter       beach     clipart   commodity 
 0.40        0.39        0.39        0.39        0.39        0.39
</code></pre>

<p>Bill:</p>

<pre><code>dollar                         1950s 
  0.87                          0.38
</code></pre>

<p>Videos are mostly on Vimeo. Dollar and bill occur together so there’s no surprises there.</p>

<p>Word clouds are a good way of quickly visualising word frequency. Here’s one of the words in the reviews:</p>

<p>I chose ten clusters arbitrarily. There’s some overlap looking at the two techniques.</p>

<p>I wanted to try out Topic Modelling on the data but an algorithm for choosing the optimal number of topics simply returned the same number as there are documents. So I tried 8, 12 and 20.</p>

<p>12 gave “nice” results:</p>

<pre><code>     Topic 1    Topic 2       Topic 3    Topic 4      Topic 5

[3,] "dollar"   "texture"     "image"    "love"       "euro"         
[4,] "direct"   "bill"        "show"     "artist"     "glitched"

[7,] "page"     "constituent" "analysis" "monochrome" "zoomed"       
[8,] "abstract" "exploding"   "another"  "pixelart"   "1990s"        
     Topic 6      Topic 7           Topic 8       Topic 9    Topic 10

[3,] "aesthetic"  "album"           "bill"        "note"     "blue"

[8,] "roughly"    "1950s"

<p>The topics are clearer with more words, these are just the first few for each one. I think this is the closest to what I want in terms of discovering what I have written about, although as I say the choice is arbitrary (or at least aesthetic rather than statistical).</p>

<p>Using more code from the Vasari/bloggers posts, we can plot the associations between words:</p>

<p><a href="/assets/2014/01/plot.png"><img src="/assets/2014/01/plot-300x300.png" alt="plot" /></a></p>

<p>Changing the parameters and outputting to PDF creates a more detailed and readable graph. It’s fun and inbetween topic modelling and frequency counts for usefulness.</p>

<p>Finally let’s see how I feel about the art with sentiment analysis:</p>

<pre><code>neutral positive 
     66        3 
</code></pre>

<p>I do try to find the positive in artworks but there was one that gave me an immediate and visceral negative reaction in the show (you can spot it if you look hard at the reviews). I’m surprised that there are fewer that count as positive. I “love” one of the pieces. Is it in the positive list?</p>

<pre><code>[1] "Martin Kohout" "Marc Stumpel"  "Ciro Múseres"
</code></pre>

<p>It’s not. But one of the ones listed does mention “love”, so I don’t know what’s happened there. Sentiment analysis has improved greatly over the last few years, but apparently not in the library I was using.</p>

<p>If I was going to use these techniques to help review art I’d write longer “bag of word” descriptions for each artwork, with fragments of text and individual words acting almost as tags or streams of consciousness, and I would then use topic modeling and clustering to help pull out themes. I’d prefer to use an algorithm to choose the number of topics, as I feel this is more intellectually defensible, but I like the results enough to use it without. I’m disappointed by the performance of the sentiment analysis library I used, next time I’ll try a different one.</p>

<p>Will there be a next time? Yes, the next time I’m reviewing a group show with more than a few artists. Producing this report has been labour intensive, but I’ve a libary of code now and a better understanding of the issues. And I can automate report construction and revision using Knitr, which would allow me to mix Markdown text and R code without hacing to copy and reformat output.</p>

        How paintr Works
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">19 Dec 2013</span>

    <p>paintr came to me very quickly just before my show in Belgrade in 2005. Originally intended as an artistic web service, it ended up as “art for the age of web services”. The original went offline when I switched web hosts a few years ago. Updating it from its php-and-blog 2005 version to a 2010s cloud-based node.js and tumblr version made sense conceptually.</p>

<p>paintr is a simple implementation of a naive model of how art is made. An artist is motivated by aesthetic concerns to find imagery to hang those concerns off of and thereby presents a work in a signature style. paintr finds a recent palette on colr.org, searches for the words that palette is tagged with on flickr, autotraces the image to simplify and abstract it, and then applies the palette to the results randomly.</p>

<p>This abstracts and unifies the image, obviously aestheticising and transforming it. The result is a kind of Stella-ish artistic ironisation of a verbal description of art. It’s also often fun to look at.</p>

        How draw-something Works
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">19 Dec 2013</span>

    <p>The version of draw-something on tumblr is a simple model of creative drawing. It’s meant to be a minimally defensible model of art, although probably a pre-postmodern art.</p>

<p>The program generates some random points (between 4 and 20, as these seemed like good numbers) and joins them in the order that they are generated as a polyline.</p>

<p>It finds the topmost point of the polyline and positions the pen a little way above it. Then it draws around the polyline, moving forward a little each time and being careful not to get too close to or too far away from it. As the program is simulating human drawing it drifts a little in direction each time. When the outline returns to be close enough to its original point, the drawing stops. The quality of the resulting line is a product of each of these factors.</p>

<p>This drawing model was informed by research into human hand movement but mostly it was derived from watching myself draw. This is a difficult thing to do, as drawing isn’t a very conscious activity. Eventually I would start drawing a line, stop myself, and try to think about what I’d been doing. This</p>

<p>The original inspiration for draw-something was Harold Cohen’s AARON, but draw-something’s output has never resembled AARON’s as both the task that the programs attempt and the way they approach it are different.</p>
