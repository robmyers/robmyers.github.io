        Two Shoe Salesmen
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">10 Nov 2009</span>

    <p>The boss of a shoe company sent two salesmen to a new country to see whether there was any market for footwear there.</p>

<p>The first salesman returned and gave his report to the boss. “Everyone there already has shoes, but if you try to change your laces you go to prison! That’s terrible! We should make sure that doesn’t happen here!”</p>

<p>The second salesman returned and gave his report to the boss. “Everyone there already has shoes, and they are much more fashionable than ours. We should stop making shoes and make a deal with their manufacturer to be their franchise here! Think of the opportunity! We just have to sign one little contract!”</p>

<p>And the moral of the story is - don’t be like the first salesman! Embrace cool and opportunity!</p>

    <h2 id="scene-16">SCENE 16.</h2>

<p>ANIMATION - AND NOW, THE SCREWDRIVER SKETCH.</p>

<h2 id="scene-17">SCENE 17.</h2>

<p>INTERIOR, DAY. A SCREWDRIVER SHOP. JUST PUT A SIGN SAYING “SCREWDRIVER SHOP” ON THE COUNTER OF THE CORNER SHOP SET FROM SCENE 8.</p>

<p>CHARACTERS - SCREWDRIVER VENDOR, BEHIND THE COUNTER IN A SHARP SUIT AND WAXED MOUSTACHE. CUSTOMER, IN WORK OVERALLS, FLAT CAP AND GLASSES.</p>

<p>CUSTOMER: Good morning, I’d like to buy a screwdriver.</p>

<p>SCREWDRIVER VENDOR: Certainly sir, what colour?</p>

<p>CUSTOMER: Red, I think. No, blue.</p>

<p>SCREWDRIVER VENDOR: Certainly, sir, just sign here.</p>

<p>CUSTOMER: What’s this?</p>

<p>SCREWDRIVER VENDOR: Oh that’s the contract for the screwdriver, sir.</p>

<p>CUSTOMER: Oh, how modern.</p>

<p>CUSTOMER SIGNS THE DOCUMENT</p>

<p>CUSTOMER: There you are.</p>

<p>SCREWDRIVER VENDOR: Thank you, sir.</p>

<p>SCREWDRIVER VENDOR HANDS BLUE SCREWDRIVER TO CUSTOMER WITH A FLOURISH.</p>

<p>BOTH TURN TO LOOK EXPECTANTLY AT THE CAMERA.</p>

<h2 id="scene-18">SCENE 18.</h2>

<p>INTERIOR, DAY.</p>

<p>A KITCHEN. ON THE TABLE IS A LARGE TRANSISTOR RADIO THAT THE CUSTOMER WANTS TO FIX.</p>

<p>CHARACTERS - CUSTOMER, SAT AT THE TABLE HOLDING A BLUE SCREWDRIVER.</p>

<p>CUSTOMER LOOKS AT THE CAMERA WAITING FOR AN UNSEEN CUE, HOLDING A BLUE SCREWDRIVER UP NEXT TO THEIR HEAD. THEY WAIT FOR A MOMENT, THEN AT THE SIGNAL OF THE UNSEEN CUE THEY LOOK AT THE RADIO AND SLOWLY START MOVING THE TIP OF THE SCREWDRIVER TOWARDS IT.</p>

<p>OFF CAMERA - A KNOCK AT THE DOOR FRONT DOOR OF THE HOUSE.</p>

<p>CUSTOMER STOPS MOVING THE SCREWDRIVER AND LOOKS BACK UP AT THE CAMERA.</p>

<p>CUSTOMER: I wonder who that could be?</p>

<h2 id="scene-19">SCENE 19.</h2>

<p>EXTERIOR, DAY.</p>

<p>THE FRONT DOOR TO THE CUSTOMER’S HOUSE.</p>

<p>CHARACTERS - CUSTOMER, SCREWDRIVER VENDOR, POLICEMAN, KNIGHT.</p>

<p>SCREWDRIVER VENDOR IS STOOD OUTSIDE THE FRONT DOOR.</p>

<p>CUSTOMER, HOLDING THE BLUE SCREWDRIVER AGAINST THEIR CHEST ABSENT-MINDEDLY, OPENS THE DOOR AND LOOKS OUT.</p>

<p>CUSTOMER: Oh hello.</p>

<p>SCREWDRIVER VENDOR: I’m sorry, sir but you can’t do that.</p>

<p>CUSTOMER: Do what?</p>

<p>SCREWDRIVER VENDOR: There’s no need to be common, sir. I was just saying that you cannot do that.</p>

<p>CUSTOMER: No, I mean what can’t I do?</p>

<p>SCREWDRIVER VENDOR: You cannot use the nice shiny blue screwdriver I gave you earlier to open that grubby old radio.</p>

<p>CUSTOMER: Why not?!</p>

<p>SCREWDRIVER VENDOR: Well, sir, if you’d read the contract you signed you’d have seen that you have to buy a red screwdriver to open radios with. Not a blue one.</p>

<p>CUSTOMER: That sounds a bit stupid if you ask me.</p>

<p>SCREWDRIVER VENDOR: Well it’s very fortunate that I didn’t, then, isn’t it? But think of the alternative, sir. You’d be able to use that screwdriver for anything.</p>

<p>CUSTOMER: Well that seems perfectly reasonable to me. I mean, after all I bought it!</p>

<p>SCREWDRIVER VENDOR: You <em>licenced</em> it, sir.</p>

<p>CUSTOMER: I should be free to use it however I want! Well, unless I was going to lever paint tins open with it, possibly. Or stab someone. But that doesn’t strike me as any of your business! Just sell the bloody screwdriver and get on with your life!</p>

<p>SCREWDRIVER VENDOR: But sir! Imagine if you could just use the screwdriver however you wanted, imagine if I was not free to tell you how to use the screwdrivers that I sell-</p>

<p>CUSTOMER: Licence.</p>

<p>SCREWDRIVER VENDOR: Ah! Yes, my mistake, thank you; licence - you. I would not be free to do business as I wish, and that would be slavery for me! Slavery!</p>

<p>CUSTOMER: You’re loopy!</p>

<p>SCREWDRIVER VENDOR: No, sir, I am just a man who loves freedom more than you do.</p>

<p>CUSTOMER: No you don’t!</p>

<p>SCREWDRIVER VENDOR: Yes I do!</p>

<p>CUSTOMER: No you don’t!</p>

<p>SCREWDRIVER VENDOR: Yes I do!</p>

<p>CUSTOMER: No you don’t!</p>

<p>SCREWDRIVER VENDOR: Yes I do!</p>

<p>CUSTOMER: No you don’t!</p>

<p>SCREWDRIVER VENDOR: Yes I do!</p>

<p>CUSTOMER REMEMBERS THAT HE IS HOLDING THE SCREWDRIVER AND LOOKS AT IT.</p>

<p>CUSTOMER: Wait a minute, this isn’t the screwdriver I bought off you, this is my <em>old</em> blue screwdriver!</p>

<p>SCREWDRIVER VENDOR: Yeah, right! Prove it!</p>

<p>CUSTOMER: Well alright I’ll just give it to someone else then!</p>

<p>SCREWDRIVER VENDOR: You <em>really</em> didn’t read the small print, did you sir?</p>

<p>THE SCREWDRIVER VENDOR BECKONS TO THE THE POLICE OFFICER WHO IS WAITING OFF-CAMERA.</p>

<p>THE POLICE OFFICER WALKS UP TO THE CUSTOMER, PUTS HIS HAND ON THE CUSTOMERS SHOULDER AND LEADS THE CUSTOMER OFF-SET.</p>

<p>THE CUSTOMER LOOKS DEJECTED AND SHAKES HIS HEAD ON THE WAY.</p>

<p>THE SCREWDRIVER VENDOR WATCHES, LOOKING SMUG.</p>

<p>A KNIGHT IN PLATE ARMOUR WALKS SLOWLY UP TO THE SCREWDRIVER VENDOR FROM BEHIND AND HITS HIM OVER THE HEAD WITH A PLUCKED CHICKEN.</p>

        HOWTO Search For Public Domain ebooks Using Google Books and archive.org
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">08 Oct 2009</span>

    <p>If you are looking for electronic versions of old public domain books and journals you can get good results by using Google Books and archive.org together.</p>

<p>Start with Google Books, which has more metadata and more search options than archive.org. Despite much-publicised metadata failures on some books, most books have useful date, author and title information, and many can be searched inside. I’ve found that the useful search constraints are date (for example 1850 to 1900 when searching for Victoriana) and then one or more of author, title, exact phrase or subject keyword.</p>

<p>Always use the advanced search interface -</p>

<p><a href="http://books.google.com/advanced_book_search">http://books.google.com/advanced_book_search</a></p>

<p>Don’t limit the search to “Full Books Only” unless you are searching specifically for epub format ebooks. Epub is a great way of getting a structured copy of a book that you can read on a mobile device, copy and paste from and translate to other formats, but many more books are availabe as PDFs. The only problem with PDF versions of books is that Google Books doesn’t provide downloads for all of them.</p>

<p>Once you’ve found the title of a book you want but that Google doesn’t provide a PDF download for, search for that title on archive.org. It will almost always be there but you may have to select the correct edition, or choose between different versions from different libraries or from projects other than Google Books. Go to the book’s page and don’t click on “Download PDF” which sends you back to Google, who don’t have it. Instead click on the link to “All Files”, then download the PDF (or the DJVU, or the text extracted from the DJVU) from there.</p>

<p>There’s nothing to stop you searching archive.org for authors, title words of keywords as well. archove.org is used by projects other than Google Books. gutenberg.org has the texts of many old books as well, and provides html and epub versions of illustrated books as well. But as a new resource with some rough edges, Google Books is a useful new research resource for historical sources.</p>
