<p><em>We need to rethink DRM and its role in preserving artistic livelihoods.</em></p>

<p>Yes. IF DRM works it will prevent artists becoming popular and destroy the lasting publicity value of their recordings. If it doesn’t work it will simply annoy fans. So thinking about it, we need to make sure that DRM doesn’t work, otherwise artistic livelihoods will suffer.</p>

<p>I don’t think that’s the kind of thinking that’s being pleaded for, though.</p>

<p>There is a common fantasy that using the Internet or a Creative Commons licence will magically make you rich and famous just by you releasing a single file. When this fantasy is shown to be just that, people don’t blame their own laziness or naivete, they blame the internet or the licence. Talent (assuming you have it) is only part of the equation of success. It takes damn hard work, a lot of overtime, schmoozing, no small amount of publicity, working the circuit and a good accountant to have even a chance at success. The commons does not offset laziness or naivete, but the media industry does exploit it. Anyone who thinks that copyleft will destroy the recording industry’s ability to make them a millionaire might want to ask a few one-hit wonders what “recover expenses” means in a contract, and how you retrain as an accountant.</p>

<p>The assumption that every artist or musician has special social and economic privileges by virtue of their genius is a Romantic conceit that is exploited by middlemen to -er- exploit artists of whatever talent. And to try to create a kind of copyright gentry with mere listeners and viewers (and artists) as serfs. You need to be able to deal with irony (or at least doublethink) in this area, otherwise you end up pleading for industry cartels against the public in the name of struggling artists.</p>

<p>The commons won’t reward talent any more than copyright does. Deal with it.</p>

        Chordinator - Sort By Value

    <p>This version sorts by value (brightness - saturation), but still only alters brightness. The effects are good, although some colours are obviously too saturated for their position. Possibly saturation needs linearising as well. So the dark blue in the first palette below looks too dark for its position (it isn’t, but it is too saturated), and the magenta in the palette below it looks too bright (again, it isn’t, but the saturation is out of position).</p>

<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2006/07/200607212144-1.jpg"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2006/07/200607212144-1-tm.jpg" alt="200607212144-1" /></a></p>

<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2006/07/200607212145.jpg"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2006/07/200607212145-tm.jpg" alt="200607212145" /></a></p>

<p>I tried linearising the saturation as well but that looked too bland. I’ll try it again, but looking at the illustrations in “Colouring Without Seeing” I think the colours in figure 16 have the same quality of occasional intensity mismatches. Or possibly its just the greater difference in colour between those colours and their neighbours.</p>

<p>Much better. I now need to add the conceptual colour stuff from <strong>ae **and</strong> cybernetic**, beef up the slipnet and assign colour values to the colour names. This will allow the colours to be chosen referentially and relationally rather than randomly.</p>

<p>When I roll this code back into draw-something the colours from the palette will be applied to the shapes in a  drawing by varying them conceptually (tint/tone scales and shadow/midtone/highlight-type application). The palette will be organised something like plane/object/group/item, with each stage adding a function to be composed to get the final value (I’m using closures like a real Lisp programmer now! :-) ).</p>

    <p>chordinator is the name of the stand-alone colour palette generator for rob-art. It’s based on the system that Harold Cohen describes in “Colouring Without Seeing”.</p>

<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2006/07/200607192131.jpg"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2006/07/200607192131-tm.jpg" alt="200607192131" /></a></p>

<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2006/07/200607192130-1.jpg"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2006/07/200607192130-1-tm.jpg" alt="200607192130-1" /></a></p>

<p>I think I need to combine the brightness and saturation scores into a single value, and possibly add weights for different parts of the colour wheel.</p>

<p>When it’s working well I’ll roll the code into draw-something (it currently uses copied-and-pasted versions of the colour and postscript code).</p>
