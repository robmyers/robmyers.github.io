        FLOSS Manuals Shouldn't Publish NC Books
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">10 Mar 2009</span>

    <p>(Update 13/3/09 - Adam from FLOSS Manuals points out in the comments that the licence page already says that the book will be re-licenced under the GPL. D’oh! Sorry FLOSS Manuals! But I still don’t think you guys should be publishing the book NC in the mean time…)</p>

<p>FLOSS Manuals is an excellent project providing manuals for Free Software. I gave the project a good review <a href="http://www.furtherfield.org/displayreview.php?review_id=317">here</a>, and I’ve written scripts to convert its HTML to <a href="/weblog/2009/02/08/floss-manuals-to-plucker/">ebooks</a>.</p>

<p>FLOSS Manuals have been using the GPL for their manuals, which is a good licence if a strange choice for software manuals, but their latest manual, a digital art handbook, is licenced under Creative Commons’s Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike licence (NC-SA).</p>

<p>NC-SA is not a free licence by any definition. The FSF, OSI, Debian and Freedom Defined all reject it. It has no place in a project calling itself “FLOSS”.</p>

<p>It would be better for FLOSS Manuals not to publish this book than to break their principles in this way, particularly given the project’s robust rejection of the FDL for <a href="http://en.flossmanuals.net/bin/view/Blog/LicenseChange">lesser reasons</a>.</p>

<p>There are already other NC-SA Digital Art Textbooks available. What would be exciting, if it’s going to be CC licenced, would be a BY-SA one.</p>

<p>FLOSS Manuals should switch to BY-SA generally if the FDL is not acceptible. I’m not suggesting dual-licencing, which would just compound the problem, I’m suggesting re-licensing the project as a whole as BY-SA. This would answer FLOSS Manuals’ concerns about the FDL much better than using the NC.</p>

<p>But in the mean time, FLOSS Manuals should either relicence or pull the digital art manual. Because NC isn’t FLOSS.</p>

    <span class="post-date">27 Feb 2009</span>

    <p>Someone emailed me to ask if they could use a modified version of one of my BY-SA images as the icon for their Android application.</p>

<p>After thinking about how icons are used on desktops, in installers, in about boxes, by launchers, and in other ways I decided that BY-SA wouldn’t affect those uses (I am not a lawyer, and I am open to correction), so I wouldn’t cause any problems by confirming that the licence allowed this use.</p>

<p>I emailed back to say that I thought that the licence should cover the creation and use of a derived work as an application icon, and asked if the application was free software. They said no. I had deliberately waited until answering their query before asking this, as I didn’t want to appear to be considering it in my decision.</p>

<p>Sometimes free software and free culture do end up as separate magisteria. They shouldn’t be, but the details of how we support them don’t always ensure that they complement each other in every situation.</p>

        Diffable Bitmaps

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">27 Feb 2009</span>

    <p>Is there a bitmap image format that can be diffed for meaningful version control? If not, could one be created?</p>

<p>SVG is a diffable vector image format that can be used in version control systems without them having to know anything about its internals. Ideally a bitmap equivalent would just be diffable as a text file, but if this isn’t practical and if special tools could achieve the same results that might be acceptable.</p>

<p>Imagine an XML (sigh) or YAML-style image format for bitmaps. Uncompressed pixel data takes up a lot of room, but the format could be compressed on disk and the diffs compressed to send over the network. This would require support for the format from VCS tools, or some sort of shadow file for the bitmap created by programs that work with it.</p>

<p>Or imagine an image diff utility that saves diff scripts for arbitrary images and provides this information to the VCS system.</p>

<p>Either way, the result should be meaningful, mergeable diffs for a multi-layered multi-attribute arbitrary-depth modern bitmap format(s).</p>

        Use The GPL For 3D Design, Not BY-SA
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">27 Feb 2009</span>

    <p>For a physical object that is the product of an art, craft, product design or engineering project you will need to be able to refer its design, to the plans, designs, instructions or CAD files if you need to study, repair, modify or copy it. Without the design, you cannot easily create repaired, improved or modified versions of the object.</p>

<p>The right to modify a work can be enforced through copyleft. But the copyleft of Creative Commons’s Attribution Share-Alike (BY-SA) licence, which is intended for artistic and design works, applies only to the finished object, not to any preparatory work. This would mean that it would not be an effective copyleft for projects where you need to ensure access to the designs for the finished object.</p>

<p>To create an effective copyleft for a 3D object (where that object is copyrightable), apply the GNU General Public License to the designs for it. Declare the object to be the “binary” and the design to be the “source”. Then anyone who receives a copy of the object can request the designs under the terms of the GPL.</p>

<p>Using the GPL rather than BY-SA ensures that anyone who receives a copy of the object can receive a copy of the designs for it (where the object is covered by copyright) without which the GPL is only as strong as BY-SA. The GPL does mention associated rights, so design rights might also be covered, but these do not apply as globally as copyright. But where a Creative Commons licence might otherwise apply and where access to designs is important (which is probably everywhere), the GPL is a better alternative.</p>

<p>(I am not a lawyer, this is not legal advice.)</p>
