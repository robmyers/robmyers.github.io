        Minara CL Conversion Complete

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">29 Dec 2007</span>

    <p>Minara’s codebase is now converted to Common Lisp and I have added the functions and constants to cl-opengl that are needed for polygon rendering.</p>

<p>Now for debugging…</p>

        The Year In Albums 2007
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">28 Dec 2007</span>

    <p>In no particular order:</p>

<p><strong>Strange House - the Horrors</strong></p>

<p>Excellent hammond-organ-and-grinding-guitar driven gothic pastiche of garage rock that starts with a cover of “Jack The Ripper” just to let you know that they know that you know. A vibrant, literate and surprisingly affecting wild ride of an album that, like all the best Goth, lets you in on the joke.</p>

<p><strong>CSS - CSS</strong></p>

<p>A sexy, mischievous energy and a love of American New Wave and 80s pop make for Brazil’s coolest export since Sergio Mendez. Fun, infectious, and liberated/ing.</p>

<p><strong>Mantaray - Siouxsie</strong></p>

<p>Free from the weight of the history of her previous bands, Siouxsie survives her transformation into an “artist” in the “content industry” with dignity intact and voice better than ever. She deserves better backing but this is still an excellent album. Find the videos “leaked” on YouTube and catch her live next year.</p>

<p><strong>Fur And Gold - Bat For Lashes</strong></p>

<p>A wonderful continuation of the English tradition of fey, visionary, referentially open popular music that starts with a harpsichord riff and goes on from there. “Prescilla” is my favourite song of the year.</p>

<p><strong>The Imagined Village - The Imagined Village</strong></p>

<p>If a camel is a horse designed by committee then The Imagined Village is Bat For Lashes delivered late and over budget by a PFI conglomerate.</p>

<p><strong>Prinzhorn Dance School - Prinzhorn Dance School</strong></p>

<p>Sadly for an art school joke band, “The Horn” have some good songs and an often melancholy vibe that distracts from the important stuff like them making their own teapots. A slow, disquieting, stripped down, bassy, indie rock sound.</p>

<p><strong>Sighs Trapped By Liars - The Red Krayola with Art &amp; Language</strong></p>

<p>The American rockers and the English conceptual artists team up for an album with a very contemporary-sounding retro psychedelia and cool rock feel and a pair of female vocalists mirroring the pair of male lyricists. The songs are about Rimbaud, the editors of October, Samuel Beckett, various economic idiocies and several artworks by Art &amp; Language. They are understated, savage, and very successful both as left-field music and left-wing art.</p>

<p><strong>We Are All Pan’s People - The Focus Group</strong></p>

<p>More of the excellent same from one of Ghost Box Records’s stable of English retro-electro outfits. Analogue synths mashed up with library albums of spoken word and incidental music tracks underwitten by the brooding feel of a countryside that is more Summerisle than Ambridge.</p>

<p><strong>An End Has A Start - Editors</strong></p>

<p>If Coldplay’s management had told them to try to sound more like Joy Division this would have been the result. Near-empty stadia await.</p>

<p><strong>Our Love To Admire - Interpol</strong></p>

<p>No, you can’t be the next Coldplay either. Not yours. What happened to the band that produced “Turn On The Bright Lights”?</p>

<p><strong>War Stories - UNKLE</strong></p>

<p>Heavy, rocky, gothy, post-Trip Hop dirty beats from UNKLE. Forget the insipid electronica of their second album and enjoy the sonic attack of this affecting and danceable return to form.</p>

<p><strong>Myths Of The Near Future - Klaxons</strong></p>

<p>Dance opportunism from some very well-read indie boys but who cares when it sounds this good? “Atlantis To Interzone” is a classic and if they can avoid going prog rock then great things await them.</p>

<p>OK, what did I miss?</p>

        Like That And Metaprogramming
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">28 Dec 2007</span>

    <p><a href="/art/like-that/">Like That</a> is a series of moving images made using Processing. It’s intended as a long series of works. So far I’ve been writing each one by hand, which has hampered my rate of progress.</p>

<p>Inspired by Lisp metaprogramming techniques I’ve realized that the best way of making Like That will be to generate the code for each piece using another program. Rather than messing around with OOP where it isn’t needed, each component of a piece (the shapes, colours and animation) will be defined as a procedure with set parameters that can be combined with a skeleton or scaffold programatically to make a .pde file to build using Processing.</p>

<p>Each set of different versions of functions will be stored in a separate file then parsed and combined. Like That will be the cross product of the sets of versions of each function. This ties in nicely with the maths pieces I’ve been working on as well.</p>

<p>I’ll use Lisp for this. It would be nicely recursive if I used Processing instead, but Lisp is my language of choice for most things and this is well within its out-of-the-box capabilities.</p>
