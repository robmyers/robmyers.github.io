        Facecoin at The New Sublime

<h6 id="image-copyright-shardcorehttpstwittercomerocdrahsstatus508221225009971201photo1">(Image copyright <a href="https://twitter.com/erocdrahs/status/508221225009971201/photo/1">@shardcore</a>)</h6>

<p>Facecoin is being shown in the show <a href="http://thenewsublime.com/?p=73">The New Sublime</a> at <a href="http://www.phoenixbrighton.org/exhibitions/the-new-sublime/">The Phoenix Gallery</a> in Brighton from September 6th-28th 2014.</p>

<p>You can read about Facecoin at The New Sublime <a href="http://thenewsublime.com/?p=122">here</a>. It’s in some amazing company in the show, do get to see it if you can.</p>

<p>Facecoin is sublime not in the sense of being delightful but in the sense of being an attempt at cognizing the aesthetics of an encounter with a phenomenon overwhelmingly greater than oneself. Rather than God, the landscape, a storm or some other natural or supernatural event, for Facecoin that phenomenon is the activity of cryptocurrency software. The inhuman scale and super-Stakhanivite work of Bitcoin’s network of computers forms an economic Skynet of loving grace. Facecoin offers a way in to contemplating this, and thereby provides an encounter with the sublime.</p>
