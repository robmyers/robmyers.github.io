        BLAHY
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">20 May 2007</span>

    <p><em>The dialectical possibilities presented by BLAHY [i.e. Young British Art] and its others are highly fugitive. British sculpture in the grand manner confers necessity on the Chapman brothers, just as the post-structuralist academy compels the existence of Practical Uses for Theoretical Essays. The necessity disappears as soon as it is identified. The artistic matter of BLAHY is marked with the philistine and the everyday all over. It is simultaneously inflected with the rebarbative aesthetics of adolescence and public relations. The useful stuff is swallowed by its empty self-description and by the barbarities of its distribution. BANK is almost alone in recognising the practical significance of the contradictions involved.</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Art &amp; Language, “BLAHY”.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is universally recognised that the Chapmans are quite serious. So is the average teenage poet. They are the twin Adrian Moles of art.</p>

<p>When I was working at the ICA they were putting up Chapmanworld. Out of politeness I declined to talk to an American camera crew. I didn’t say “It’s trying to pretend that it’s not trying to shock, and it’s failing. It’s tired, academic, adolescent bollocks of the lowest order. It will go far.”</p>

        Like That
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">19 May 2007</span>

    <p>The name “like that” comes from two places. The first is the remix of the Run DMC song “That’s The Way It Is”. The second is from my youngest son’s use of “like that!” as a general assertion when he was little (equivalent to “really!” or “I’m serious!”).</p>

<p>The colour schemes are: white (actually grey) from Rachel Whiteread’s “House”, multicoloured (randomly) from Julian Opie’s “Imagine You can Order These”, (caucausian) flesh pink (from Jeff Koons and from Art &amp; Language’s “Now They Are), black (actually grey) from Malevich, and red yellow blue and black from De Stijl.</p>

<p>The forms are squares (from any modernist work), cubes (ditto, but with special reference to Opie’s modernist deconstruction), circles (from more practical data visualization), arrows, and silhouettes of various real-world objects.</p>

<p>The compositional schemes are a simple scatter burst, a radial burst, and various kaleidoscope schemes.</p>

<p>The intent is to create visual allegories for various experiences and activities and conditions. Events, travel, war, art, various aspects of social history notably to do with race and sexuality.</p>

<p>This is a sequel of sorts to Inbetween Cities, strongly influenced by yBA art but with an emphasis on a kind of temporal grammar or rhythm all of its own. It is far simpler visually than technology currently allows (I am always a late early adopter) but hopefully far subtler and richer.</p>

<p>It is haunted by the kitsch spectre of screensavers, but hopefully rescued from this by its failure as distracting spectacle. If it doesn’t end up far enough from Inbetween cities it will be a failure. It is not object orient and is neither chaotic nor anti-war. The possibility of success requires the possibility of failure, even its likelihood. I have a lot to pull together and move beyond here.</p>
