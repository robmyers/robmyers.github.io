        You Can't Spell Fungible Without Fun

    <p>There are artworks that are very similar technically but utterly
distinct culturally and historically. Take the examples of a Kasimir
Malevich painting of a black square from revolutionary Russia and an Ad
Reinhardt painting of a black square from 1960s America. Technically
speaking you can’t get much more basic than a black square, but
culturally speaking there’s no way you can swap one of those black
squares for any other.
In contrast, software consists of easily substituted black boxes of
functionality whose formal qualities are insignificant (Vi and Emacs
aside ;-) ).
Stallman’s Four Freedoms are freedoms of <em>use</em>; the freedom to operate
software as a tool, as a means to an end. Stallman has written, briefly,
about how he views the freedom to use non-software works. That freedom
decreases the less the work is a means and the more it is an end, from
educational resources through to works of opinion and expression.
So fungibility for code and culture may simply be a product of the
degree to which something is a means rather than an end.
In contrast to Stallman’s freedom of use, the EFF use the concept of
freedom of speech to argue for people’s ability to work with software.
When we talk about free culture in general then if it has any meaning it
is primarily as a synonym for freedom of speech.
In order to speak freely, you must be free to refer to and quote the
words (or sounds or images or…) of others. And because of the
non-fungibility of cultural works, no other words (or sounds or images
or…) can be substituted.
A text editor works on a novel or a program listing equally well, and in
some jurisdictions software is regarded as a literary work for the
purpose of copyright. Different criteria of freedom may apply to the
fixed forms of software and art, but the restrictions are just the same.
For free software, part of the solution to this was alternative
copyright licensing.
So fungibility is related to use but free culture is concerned with
speech. It is not the case that free culture supposes or can in any way
cause cultural fungibility. And the non-fungibility of cultural works is
precisely why free culture requires the same solutions as free software
does at the level of copyright.</p>

    <p>Five years and several Wiki restores ago I wrote a sketch of an article called “<a href="/wiki/index.php/How_To_Get_Paid_For_Copyleft_Art">How To Get Paid For Copyleft Art</a>”. My opinion at the time was that cultural projects (or artistic careers) could be structured to make money using copyleft, but I was very wary of recommending any particular services for digital media.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.digitalproductions.co.uk/index.php?id=264">Crosbie Fitch has been working on this sort of thing for a while</a>. And recently some other projects that support different ways of funding projects have started gaining in popularity.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/">Kickstarter</a> is best known in free culture and free software circles for funding Diaspora, but there are lots of other projects on there (I contributed towards the Mondo 2000 History Project for example). It’s an escrow or street performer protocol system where people promise to create or do something if contributors promise the right amount of funding.</p>

<p><a href="http://flattr.com/">Flattr</a> is a micropayments service that allows you to add a donation button to blogs and other social media. I’ve started seeing this on blogs I read. There’s a flattr plugin for Android apps that might be a good way of getting funding from users of published free software.</p>

<p><a href="http://vodo.net/">VoDo</a> is a peer-to-peer movie sharing
network (using Bittorrent) that allows you to sponsor the creators of
the work shared over the network.</p>

<p>And even good old <a href="https://www.paypal.com/">PayPal</a> buttons are increasingly being used to accept contributions in exchange for downloads. I just paid for a download of the “<a href="http://www.hardabud.com/jollyroger/">Jolly Roge</a>r” comic in this way.</p>

<p>These systems all offer ways of getting money in
exchange for artistic labour that are sorely needed. But they are all proprietary systems run by for-profit companies, so the
revolution will be monetized.</p>

    <p>Some time ago I mentioned <a href="/weblog/2008/01/sharing-is-sexy-open-source-porn-laboratory-sex-positive-collective.html">Sharing is Sexy</a>, a Free Culture porn project. The site seems to be offline unfortunately (archive.org has a <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080319140930/http://www.sharingissexy.org/">cache</a>). But now there’s a new Free Culture Porn site, <a href="http://www.freedomporn.org/smut/Freedom_Porn">FreedomPorn.org</a> :</p>

<blockquote>_Introducing, [FreedomPorn.org](http://www.freedomporn.org/smut/Freedom_Porn), the world's first ever free-as-in-freedom porn site, comprised of entirely [free cultural works](http://freedomdefined.org/Definition)
in free formats, both Ogg Theora and WebM. Freedom Porn (FP) is a
participatory resource for ethical smut, promoting our favorite ideals,
and running on donations. From the about page:  
  
_
&gt; 
&gt; <blockquote>_The mission of **Freedom Porn** is to
empower and engage individuals to create and share ethical porn as a
means of advancing sex-positivism and sexual freedom._
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; 

&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; _We advocate safer sex and consensual sex, and feminism is inseparable
from our mission. We also fight for freedom of speech, privacy,
and free culture._
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt; </blockquote>
&gt; 
&gt; </blockquote>

<p>Sounds good. I’m glad that the project has a specifically feminist element and that it’s using free video formats. That last sentence shouldn’t read as strangely as it does.</p>

    <p>I’ve written a Gtk+ user interface for draw-something to help evaluate its output.</p>

<p>You’ll need the git repository for draw something, and cl-gtk2 installed:</p>

<p>sbcl<br />
(asdf:oos ‘asdf:load-op :asdf-install)<br />
(asdf-install:install :cl-gtk2-gtk)<br />
(asdf-install:install :cl-gtk2-cairo)</p>

<p>git clone /git/draw-soemthing.git</p>

<p>Then you can run the gtk.lisp script in src:</p>

<p>cd draw-something/src<br />
sbcl –load gtk.lisp</p>

<p>And once you select “New Drawing” you can view the different stages of its development. Which is very useful. I must add a File menu so people can use this to save images as well.</p>
