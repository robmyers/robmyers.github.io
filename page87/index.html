<blockquote>_Rails-style generator system for creating and managing digital art projects._</blockquote>

<p>Over the last few years I’ve developed a fairly standard directory layout and project lifecycle for my art image projects. If you download an archive from a project page at <a href="/art">/art</a> you’ll see there’s a folder with the project’s name containing a LICENSE file and directories named “final” and “discard”. During the course of a project I make images and sort them into “final” for images I’ll put on the web page and that should be considered part of the finished project and “discard” for images that don’t make the grade.</p>

<p>This can be automated to a degree, so inspired by Ruby On Rails I’ve created a system to create the directory layout and add scripts to move work between directories, bundle them up for release, and generate web pages to display the images.</p>

<p>Currently the project is going under the terrible title of “art_generators”. I really need a better title, something like Rails, so any suggestions will be gratefully received. Cerise, plinth and sketchbook are ideas so far.</p>

<p>I’ll bundle this up as a Ruby gem when it’s ready for other people to use, but the project creation code works OK and interfaces with SVN. I’ll be using it for a couple of projects to get the rest of the scripts working well, then I’ll do an initial release.</p>

        Portrait of the Artist as a Young Mac Operator
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">26 Aug 2008</span>

    <p>The way artists make art often reflect the means of production of their age. The artist of feudalism was an artisan or alchemist, the Renaissance artist was adept at mathematics and geometry inspired by trade and war, and Andy Warhol’s factory embodied the spirit of mass production.</p>

<p>If you looked in the jobs pages in the early 1990s, you’d see adverts for “Mac Operators”. A Mac Operator would use the only Apple Macintosh in the company to do design work using Illustrator, Photoshop and Quark at a low rate of pay.</p>

<p>When I got to art school at around that time I begged and borrowed access to Macs to make art using Photoshop and Illustrator. I acted out the role of the Mac Operator (rather than alchemist, merchant or factory worker) without realising it to make art.</p>

<p>The Mac Operator is a kind of knowledge worker. Knowledge work is post-industrial work. Another example of post-industrialism is brand-based outsourcing. The production of Jeff Koon’s artistic brand is outsourced. But Koons is a manager rather than a worker.</p>

<p>Mac Operators were representative producers of mass culture at that time. But Web 2.0 means that everyone can now use a computer to produce culture as part of the crowd. Outsourcing has become crowdsourcing. Mac Operators, like sign painters, are not now a contemporary phenomenon.</p>

<p>I started out remixing images, and I continue to do so, aided now by the Creative Commons licences so beloved of Web 2.0. I am still sat at a computer producing art as an individual, rather than using the crowd to do so. But I am using a GNU laptop rather than a Power Mac desktop system.</p>

<p>The laptop-based knowledge work figure is the “laptop warrior” or the Bay-area coffee-shop wifi leeching “bedouin”. These are the people who start the Web 2.0 companies and web applications that the crowd use to produce their culture.</p>

<p>So I haven’t ended up as far from the contemporary creative practice of computing as I’d feared. And I’m not criticising artists who mimic Web 2.0 strategies without adding anything to them, when I do criticise them, from a position of historical irrelevance. I’m just reflecting a different aspect of current computer-based production.</p>

        On Hipsterism
      </a>

    <span class="post-date">26 Aug 2008</span>

    <p>Adbusters have noticed hipsterism:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.adbusters.org/magazine/79/hipster.html">http://www.adbusters.org/magazine/79/hipster.html</a></p>

<blockquote>_We are a lost generation, desperately clinging to anything that feels real, but too afraid to become it ourselves. We are a defeated generation_</blockquote>

<p>Apparently The The aren’t on Gnutella.</p>

<p>K-punk has a good critique of the article and Hipsterism in general that is well worth reading in full:</p>

<p><a href="http://k-punk.abstractdynamics.org/archives/010588.html">http://k-punk.abstractdynamics.org/archives/010588.html</a></p>

<blockquote>_the problem with "hipsters" is precisely that they are pathologically well-adjusted, untroubled by sexual anxieties or financial worries. Vulgar Freudianism is not without its point - where is the motivation to produce art in people who can get any satisfaction they want, at any time? The very seamlessness of these unalienated, guilt-free lives leaves no material for sublimation._</blockquote>

<p>I loathe hipsterism, but what else <em>can</em> there be in a society where most of the history of mass culture is a mouse click away and where everyone can broadcast their lives (also with a click of the mouse) in a way that only mass media personalities could previously? The cultural smog of the post-Napster Internet works against the scarcity and instant obsolescence that defined previous mass culture.</p>

<p>And besides, the aim of youth culture has always been to upset the eldsters. ;-) Punk parents would need something pretty radical to upset them. The laid-back ambient historicism of hipsterism certainly does the trick if its lack of something new is something new.</p>

<p>I remember watching a 1960s documentary from Swinging London that announced in a voice-over that “The Forties Are Back”. As a kid in the late 80s, 60s psychedelia was big with my cooler friends. The past has always been big. And postmodernism was an 80s thing.</p>

<p>If it’s not the case that hipsterism is just the usual 20-year cycle hitting 80s postmodernism and sample culture then perhaps the hipster generation is just the first with both the economic and technological power to beat the twenty year limit.</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.adamfrisby.com/blog/2008/08/opensim-c-standards-patents-and-you/">http://www.adamfrisby.com/blog/2008/08/opensim-c-standards-patents-and-you/</a>A brilliant blog post that answers many of the concerns I raised about OpenSim’s use of C#.A couple of points.</p>

<blockquote>_If Microsoft decide to add new extensions onto .NET (which they have done with every major release), the OpenSim developers are content to wait until those extensions are available under Mono (which moves fast enough that it isn't a major problem)._</blockquote>

<p>Does this mean that there will be elements of Mono, used in OpenSim, that will not be included in the ECMA standard and potentially will not be covered by Microsoft’s patent pledges?</p>

<blockquote>_Java is a beast of a language that has had layers of gunk added in every revision resulting in a hodge-podge of inconsistently named items in the standard library that may, or may not address what you want. The second major reason is that the C# standard library is both larger and more functional - the amount of time and effort the Base Class Library has saved is astonishing._</blockquote>

<p>I got fed up with Java with the 1.1 release (Swing and inner classes were turds), so I hold no brief for Java. C# looks like it has some nice CLOS-style accessor magic. I would be surprised if C# has better libraries in aggregate (including the net rather than just out of the box), though.</p>
