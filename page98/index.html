    <p>I’ve had very little energy recently (no idea, possibly a virus, no not a computer virus, work with me here) and so I’m behind on just about everything I’m meant to be doing. I’ve also been reading Batman and Silver Surfer collections that the library has in. Oh and the T&amp;H; “Internet Art” book, “Laws Of Cool”, the second Alfred Jarry collection from Atlas Press, and “War In The Age Of Intelligent Machines” which I’ve wanted to re-read since borrowing Tessa Elliot’s copy about fifteen years ago. All of which has also got in the way of making stuff.</p>

<p>Like That is progressing slowly but surely, I’ve written some code to screenscrape art market data sites for some possible visualization work, a couple of reviews are almost ready for Furtherfield, and I got to the Open Source Embroidery show opening which was brilliant. I also had to edit my essay for the art &amp; FOSS book, which LaTeX made nice and easy.</p>

<p>As soon as I have anything to show, I’ll show it.</p>

<blockquote>_I had another child to support, but by then I was selling very well and  
had royalties and foreign rights coming in This enabled me to devote  
the kind of time I came to devote to the Pyat books which were  
something my conscience demanded I write_  
</blockquote>

<p>One of the things that I try to do as a proponent of Free Culture is to come up with ways of alleviating any negative economic consequences for producers caused by the effective absence of copyright under copyleft. I’m quite happy that I have a good grasp of how this works for fine at, for film, for television, for computer games and for popular music. But books are another matter.</p>

<p>Michael Moorcock is a literary hero of mine. In the quote above he describes supporting both his family and his art on the basis of the economic exploitation of rights that copyleft removes; sales royalties and regional market/translation fees. Neither exists under copyleft. So would Moorcock not have been able to feed his children and create the art that he was driven to make without Cory Doctorow-style NonCommercial restrictions?</p>

<p>I will ignore the question of whether he should, for some ethical value of “should”, be able to or not. As far as I am concerned it would have been a loss to culture had the Cornelius and Pyat stories not have been produced. A loss of positive freedom (to use Berlin’s terminology) would have resulted as these amazing resources for the collective imagination would not have existed. I support this end, I’m just talking about the means.</p>

<p>No single solution can replicate the effects of copyright (no single application of copyright replicates the effects of copyright…) but I think that its benefits can be approximated. Can that approximation replace copyright economically speaking, and thereby generate a cultural superstructure of the kind that Moorcock’s copyright did and does?</p>

<p>I need to work on this.</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2008/05/13/robert-rauschenberg.html">Robert Rauschenberg, RIP - Boing Boing</a></p>

<blockquote>Robert Rauschenberg, a pioneer of multimedia art in the truest sense of the phrase, died last night. He was 82.  
</blockquote>

<p>Rauschenberg’s work had a massive impact on me when I first arrived at art school. His art was high stakes aesthetics in which either everything was transformed into art or… But it was always transformed into art. Rauschenberg convinced me that freedom was not only possible but worth pursuing in art, and that art could transform any materials while still (or possibly thereby) retaining a link to real life.</p>

    <p>I’m still working on various projects, notably Like That and an artworld social network data visualisation project that may be called “Information”. And I may have some good news regarding my criticism and design work as well soon.</p>

<p>I’ll post when I have something to show…</p>
