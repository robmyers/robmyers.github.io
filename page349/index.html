        The Case For Complexity
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">30 Jun 2004</span>

    <p>Article at Guardian Online.</p>

<p>Complexity or difficulty are both effects of art with internal or contextual complexity. This is art that does something, or requires that you do something. Art that has to work for its living. The mute, evacuated objects so beloved of curators and essayists of the last forty years cannot engage aesthetically or critically with anything much, and are no better than the conservative Good Old-Fashioned Art that is their Other.</p>

<p>Art open to complexity and open to making demands on viewer and artist other than “questioning” sanctioned “problematics”. Art giving rewards other than the warm fuzzy glow of throwback Beaux Arts or Institutional Burlesque. Bring it on… ;-)</p>

    <p>I’ve made very few paintings, but I need to make some now. I think that 1968 needs some painted images, and a project called “Indemnified Paintings” needs painting as well (obviously :-) ).</p>

<p>I’m reminded of Art &amp; Language talking about how paint and brushes were “kryptonite” to some conceptual artists. I came to computers at the same time as painting and printmaking, so there’s never been that ideological split for me.</p>

<p>This isn’t part of any general drift from technology, or a need to make something saleable, it’s just what I need to do. OK so I’m having fun with Conte charcoal pencils and blue col-erase at the moment as well, but I’m coding and clicking away as hard as ever. Yessir. It’s important to get the medium right and not to fetishise it.</p>

<p>Paint is a good way of making certain kinds of one-shot images. Why make it on-screen and then laboriously print it out? It’s easier to just paint it, if the process of painting or the lack of undo doesn’t get in the way. ;-)</p>

    <p>All the tools you need to make art digitally are available as Free Software projects. These aren’t toys, they are serious tools used in production on real projects.</p>

<p>Blender is an excellent 3D modelling, animation and game-making application: <a href="http://www.blender.org/">http://www.blender.org/</a></p>

<p>Renderman is the tool that’s used for rendering movie effects and computer animation, free implementations are available: <a href="http://www.renderman.org/RMR/OtherLinks/index.html#Renderers">http://www.renderman.org/RMR/OtherLinks/index.html#Renderers</a></p>

<p>For video editing there’s Kino: <a href="http://kino.schirmacher.de/">http://kino.schirmacher.de/</a></p>

<p>For frame editing there’s CinePaint (formerly Film Gimp), developed and used by Hollywood effects houses: <a href="http://www.cinepaint.org/">http://www.cinepaint.org/</a></p>

<p>For photo and image editing there’s Gimp: <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">http://www.gimp.org/</a></p>

<p>For vector illustration there’s Inkscape: <a href="http://www.inkscape.org/">http://www.inkscape.org</a>.<br />
And there will eventaully be minara :-) : <a href="http://minara.sourceforge.net/">http://minara.sourceforge.net/</a></p>

<p>For fonts (typefaces) there’s Fontforge: <a href="http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/">http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/</a></p>

<p>For desktop publishing there’s Scribus: <a href="http://www.scribus.net/">http://www.scribus.net/</a></p>

    <p>There’s an Open Source cola drink, it’s been around for a while now:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.colawp.com/colas/400/cola467_recipe.html">http://www.colawp.com/colas/400/cola467_recipe.html</a></p>

<p>Whilst this is very funny, formalising the idea of competing on manufacture &amp; distribution and collaborating on research &amp; development is one of the aspects of Free Software that transfers very well to consumer goods.</p>

<p>AdBusters would do much better to release Open Trainer designs rather than hyping their Closed “Blackspot” Trainer vapourware. Their centralised, corporatist, old-school branding just leaves me looking from man to pig…</p>

        The Institutional Theory Of Art
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">19 Jun 2004</span>

    <p>I’ve started reading “Painting As An Art”, so I’ve been thinking about the Institutional Theory of art (which Wollheim starts the book by discussing). This is the theory that art is irrelevant to art: the thing that makes art into art is its recognition by the “artworld”. Quite how the artworld recognises art I don’t know, but I think it can be summed up as: “the art world likes what it likes”. It’s not a very useful theory for actually making art, but curators love it.<br />
It’s very simple for an artwork to enforce its acceptance by the artworld, thus upsetting the Institutional Theory. If you don’t believe me, try getting a watercolour painting of a scottie dog painted by an old lady into the Tate’s modern art collection. There’s no way the artworld will accept it. Theory falsified. ;-)</p>
