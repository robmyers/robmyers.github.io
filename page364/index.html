    <p>I changed jobs, which has been very time-consuming.<br />
I’ve swapped from Python to Lisp for the drawing module. Hopefully if I use Lisp I won’t ever have to learn another programming language. :-)<br />
There was a thread about “meritocracy” in fine art on <a href="http://www.rhizome.org/">Rhizome</a>. Anyone who is confused about this sort of thing should try <a href="http://www.thejackdaw.co.uk/">The Jackdaw</a>, which is like a <a href="http://www.private-eye.co.uk/">Private Eye</a> for fine art, only genuinely funny as well as informative…</p>

    <p>I’ve been busy. I’ve been writing a drawing module similar to a very, very simple implementation of Harld Cohen’s AARON.<br />
I emailed Harold Cohen, and got a reply. :-)<br />
And I’ve been sketching and writing a lot, which hasn’t left much time for a weblog.</p>

    <p>Compare the figures in a Maloney painting to the figures in an AARON painting. AARON is working hard to reach this state, Maloney is dumbing down to it. AAARON comes from a fondness for painting, figures, and art. I don’t really care where Maloney is coming from. Both ironise the figure through technique, yet ‘s cack-handedness tells us much less about people at the end of the twentieth century than AARON. <br />
It’s the difference between Nu Metal’s not-knowing-enough-to-cover-its-ineptness signifying and electronic music, where you have to find your own soul if any. This potential for representing, ironically, humanity is becoming one of the main things that interests me in making art with technology</p>

        Cabinet Of Disinterest
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">14 Feb 2004</span>

    <p>Cabinet paintings are reviled as the precursor of kitsch. Kitsch is reviled by critics. Left-wing critics object to the content of Kitsch, which they regard as saccharine distraction, sentimental, void of social content, worse than null. Right-wing critics object to the form of kitsch; its low quality and therefore its low value. Neither particularly object to the subjects of kitsch. People, animals, scenery, all can be found in high art. If realism is the necessity of the translations required to maintain isomorphism between real-world referents and aesthetic signs, then Kitsch transformations are degenerate, destroying value and reference and substituting low-level self-referential sentimentality. Kitsch is unrealistic, even anti-realistic.</p>

<p>Cabinet paintings are also the precursors of screensavers. Small, personal distractions that ironise their context. Beyond this, it is the screensaver’s avoidance of work for the viewer to do that places it firmly in the category of kitsch. Screensavers need not be kitsch. Julian Opie has made screensavers, and AARON is available as a screensaver. In both cases the relationship of the screensaver and the user to work is what gives the piece value. Opie’s ever-changing abstract landscapes and cubes don’t allow the viewer to rest, finally forcing them to leverage their environmental aesthetic knowledge to complete the work and exercise some degree of control over the experience. The screensaver version of AARON creates original compositions at a frightening rate whenever a computer’s user isn’t doing anything else. It is working, even if the user isn’t.<br />
Critical fetishism of breakthrough and transitional works operates against anything as seemingly prosaic as the screensaver. This should be taken and ironised, or at least parodied.</p>
