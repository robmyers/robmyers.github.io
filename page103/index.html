    <p>_Rhizome is now in the midst of the sixth year of our Commissions Program – a singular initiative that supports the creation of original works of new media art work. This year, we will award seven artists/ collectives with commissions ranging from $3000-$5000.</p>

<p>Deadline for applications: midnight, March 31, 2008</p>

<p>We support: New Media Art, by which we mean projects that creatively engage new and networked technologies and also works that reflect on the impact of these tools and media in a variety of forms. Commissioned projects can take the final form of online works, performance, video, installation or sound art. Projects can be made for the context of the gallery, the public, or the web.</p>

<p>Amount: 7 commissions in the amount of $3000-5000</p>

<p>Guidelines and application forms can be found here:<br />

        On Purpose Line

    <span class="post-date">03 Mar 2008</span>

    <p>What seemed to be a problematic edge case in my implementation of the line drawing algorithm from Harold Cohen’s old essay “On Purpose” turned out to need a fundamental rewrite of much of the code (!) and I’m still not done. But I can now get results like this (with green lines for debugging):</p>

<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/cells.png" alt="cells.png" /></p>

<p>Here’s the main loop, structured to look like the flowchart from the essay:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;(defun draw-line (from to)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;(set-line-drawing-parameters from to)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;(loop named stop&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;do  (loop&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;initially (set-swing-left-or-right)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;initially (setf panic-count 0)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;do (progn&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;(set-length-of-sub-phase)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;(set-rate-of-swing)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;(loop&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;do (progn&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;(calculate-new-direction-for-line)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;(when (not (within-angular-limits))&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;(incf panic-count)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;(when (&gt; panic-count 20)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;(break))&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;(setf sub-phase-count 0) ;; Start new phase&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;(loop-finish)) ;; This will still evaluate finally&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;(correction-for-homing)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;(calculate-position-of-next-point)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;(move-to-next-point)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;(when (reached-destination)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;(return-from stop)))&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;until (end-of-sub-phase)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;finally (reverse-swing)))&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;until (end-of-phase))))&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

I’m pleased to announce today the launch of a Europe-wide campaign against the extension of copyright term. Thanks to ORG volunteers, and some very nice people I met at FOSDEM, the new campaign site - soundcopyright.eu - is available in English, French and German.</p>

<p>Please visit the site, and sign the petition.</p>

    <p><a href="http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8080">Is it possible to design non-defective DRM? - Creative Commons</a></p>

<blockquote>_If not and admittedly, we suspect this is the case, all the more reason to hasten the abandonment of DRM and the hindrance it poses to innovation, and to embrace technologies that make content more useful and empower users._</blockquote>

<p>CC are cool, and they’ve handled this very diplomatically.</p>

<p>DRM is <a href="http://defectivebydesign.org/">defective by design</a>. You can have Fair Use, or you can have DRM.</p>

<p>Rather than shunning Sun’s snake oil let’s take this as an opportunity to show, once and for all, that DRM is legally, technologically and probably mathematically incompatible with the Fair Use that has driven demand for Sun’s servers during the Internet era.</p>

<p>Please forward CC’s post as broadly as possible and get every DRM and Fair Use expert you can contact aware of this.</p>

    <p><strong>Scene:</strong> A restaurant, interior, night.</p>

<p>A man sits at a table, holding a menu.</p>

<p>A waiter approaches.</p>

<p><strong>Man:</strong> Ah, waiter. I’m ready to order. I’ll have the pate for starter, steak (rare, please) and fries with a side salad for main course, and the creme brulee for pudding. Can you recommend something to go with that?</p>

<p><strong>Waiter:</strong> Certainly, sir. If I might recommend the zinfandel this evening?</p>

<p><strong>Man:</strong> Yes I think I shall have a glass of that. Thank you, waiter.</p>

<p>The waiter walks off.</p>

<p>The man gazes off into the distance as he waits for his starter.</p>

<p>After a few moments the waiter returns, pulling a ruminating cow behind him on a piece of rope.</p>

<p><strong>Sound effect:</strong> Moo!</p>

<p><strong>Waiter:</strong> Your steak sir.</p>

<p><strong>Man:</strong> What?!</p>

<p><strong>Waiter:</strong> Your steak, sir.</p>

<p><strong>Man:</strong> What?!</p>

<p>The waiter holds up a chainsaw and pulls his goggles over his eyes. He pulls the starter cord on the chainsaw.</p>

<p><strong>Sound effect:</strong> Chainsaw petrol engine revving up.</p>

<p><strong>Man (shouting):</strong> Look I just want some steak, cooked rare, in its capacity as part of a satisfying meal of subtle and varied flavours!</p>

<p>**Waiter (revving down chainsaw): **But sir, you ordered steak.</p>

<p>**Man: **Yes, about twelve ounces of it, prepared in the kitchens, as part of the main course of a meal. With fries and a side salad. After a starter.</p>

<p><strong>Waiter (stopping chainsaw):</strong> But sir, surely if you want steak, you want more steak than you can possibly eat, steak to eleven as it were? Forget the rest of the meal, forget the subtle richness of the experience, don’t you just want to go for the full-on core proposition of the meal qua meal, i.e. the hacked up dead cow?</p>

<p><strong>Man:</strong> What?</p>

<p><strong>Waiter:</strong> The full experience of everything that steak can possibly mean, an immersive sensurround of steak! The visceral experience of steak, the subtexts of steak desublimated and given full reign to finally realise what we all know steak to be, steak set free! Steeeeaaaaaakkkkk!</p>

<p><strong>Man:</strong> What?</p>

<p><strong>Waiter:</strong> You want a bloodbath of steak you tart, don’t deny it!</p>

<p><strong>Man:</strong> I bloody well do deny it.</p>

<p><strong>Waiter (Pulling the starter on the chainsaw again):</strong> Ah, shut up you reactionary old square. You don’t have the first clue what you’re talking about. Steeeeaaaaaakkkkk! Steeeeaaaaaakkkkk!</p>
