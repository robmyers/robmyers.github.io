<blockquote>_The issue is clearly a complex one but Mark Stephens, who believes that the British Government and the Royal Academy and by implication myself, are acting in a "morally reprehensible" way understands neither culture nor morality. He should rather choose to rejoice that certain quite minor legal problems were happily resolved between Russia and Great Britain in very good faith on both sides and that as a result much happiness and pleasure is being given to so many._</blockquote>

<p>Since this is a matter of public interest I think it is fair comment to say that the above article is pathetic. It is a defence of the current British government’s craven capitulation to the current Russian administration’s demands for immunity from legal claims over the current show of art from Russian in London, some of which may have been looted by the Soviets during World War II.</p>

<p>Quite apart from anything else, paintings are autographic works and unique objects, non-fungible physical property. Play scripts are allographic mass-produced commodities, replaceable items. They do not compare, and any defense of theft of the former based on the spectre of privatisation of the latter is at best utterly flawed.</p>

<p>There’s more, but honestly. When the author’s house is next burgled I assume he will just put it behind him rather than denying the world access to the cultural wealth he has hoarded.</p>

<p>Grrr.</p>

    <p>Google’s web search engine is an index of pages on the World Wide Web constructed and constantly reconstructed by algorithms running on thousands of computers in parallel. This “PageRank’” algorithm is a mathematical formalisation of the informal heuristic that academics use to judge the influence of a published paper. The more people cite the paper, or the more people link to the document, the higher its score.</p>

<p>This is an automated solution to an organisational or methodological problem. The users of the Web are faced with a highly interlinked but highly diverse space of information to search in order to achieve their various ends. There are alternatives to this. Yahoo and Dmoz are human-managed directories rather than machine-generated indexes. Wikia is a human-managed search engine, although it is currently in its infancy.</p>

<p>In Art &amp; Language’s Index projects I see a precedent for both the practice and critique of web search. The Indexes took Art &amp; Language’s written work, highly interlinked but highly diverse, and produced an index for it based on various concepts in such a way that an imagined audience could navigate this sprawling and opaque practice.</p>

<p>The later Indexes were computer generated (randomly according to one report) or crowdsourced by Art &amp; Language New York, the earlier ones were typed up by the British group. Their production was a strong application of the technology of business (filing cabinets, typewriters, and then computers) to a social and procedural problem: how to map and represent the conversational artistic practice of Art &amp; Language in a form meaningful to the group and to an imagined audience.</p>

<p>To use the Indexes you check a table on the wall or a hand-out and then look up the relevant document in one of the filing cabinets. The bundle of notes in a plastic envelope (or on microfilm) that results may be of more general interest, and similar or different documents can be found by consulting the table further. This looks like a low-tech precursor to Googling for information.</p>

<p>The Indexes have important differences from search engines in the way they operate. Documents in the Indexes are differentiated and classified, and are unranked. Search engines use only a single information-destroying ranking measure, not positive and negative relations or grouping concepts. Directories use grouping concepts but not relations.</p>

<p>What is obscured in considering the Indexes as prehistoric search engines is their social construction and the specific purposes they served. Google’s users mostly regard it as neutral, but it is neutral only with regard to the demands of global capital. The Indexes were both the product of disagreement within Art &amp; Language and of Art &amp; Language’s ideologically radical position relative to the mainstream contemporary art of the time. It is both a product and a producer of discord and hard interpretative work both inside thr group that produced it and between that group and society.</p>

<p>The Indexes provide a historical source of concepts that can be applied to search engine production and critique, both in their social and technical production. The most important question the Indexes raise for search engines is what social forms have produced them and what social forms they produce. These questions are all the more important given search engines professed neutrality.</p>

    <p>The finished implementation of the line drawing algorithm from Harold Cohen’s essay “<a href="http://crca.ucsd.edu/~hcohen/">On Purpose</a>” <a href="http://rob-art.cvs.sourceforge.net/rob-art/rob-art/ben/on-purpose-line.lisp?revision=1.1&amp;view=markup">can be found here</a>. You’ll need a Lisp system such as SBCL to run it, the output images can be viewed with Gimp.</p>

<p>I am not happy with my implementation of the algorithm. I don’t think the “homing” functionality is robust or elegant enough, and it interacts with the angular limit code in a way that sometimes requires turns greater than the pen should allow.</p>

<p>But writing it has been a wonderful exercise in art computing historical investigation. I have learnt a lot, and gained a new appreciation for both the techniques and results of Cohen’s earliest art computing work.</p>

<p>If anyone can suggest a better homing algorithm and a better way of choosing each phases’s parameters let me know.</p>

    <p>Harold Cohen’s AARON is exemplary art. Cohen’s painting of the 1960s was world-class abstraction, a serious and capable investigation into the nature of signification in image-making. His adoption of computer technology as a way of furthering this investigation was not opportunistic or promotional, it was a natural and effective embracing of a means of furthering his artistic aims. The aesthetic and critical content of Cohen’s painting has continued and extended in his art computing work.</p>

<p>AARON is exemplary artificial intelligence software. The AARON of the 1970s was an artifical-intelligence inspired production system written in C. The AARON of the 1990s was an object-oriented Lisp system. The AARON of the 2000s is still written in Lisp and is more inspired by the new dominant paradigm of cognitive science. Each instantiation of AARON is amongst the most successful examples of its programming and conceptual paradigms. It also reflects Cohen’s biography in its subject matter (from pictograms through social imagery to abstract pictures of house plants), although I will not discuss that here.</p>

<p>AARON is a combination and mutual intensification of the symbolic logic of Cohen’s painting and that of artificial intelligence. Rather than trying to approximate the appearance of art with computer technology, or trying to apply readymade forms of computer science to image processing, Cohen broke the theory and practice of his painting down to its most basic methods and imperatives. He then painstakingly embodied this in software using the most powerful methods available of representing not images but knowledge and behaviour.</p>

<p>AARON bears comparison with the most successful expert systems of the 1970s, and its output with the most successful of Cohen’s manually produced paintings. It is competent as art because it is competent as an expert system, and vice versa. Every smallest movement of the pen is a production of the expert system, and every part of the expert system exists to model Cohen’s artmaking. This is a result of the uncompromising pursuit of the practice of art through the means of computing where those means are appropriate to the artists ends.</p>

<p>The irony is that AARON creates more human-like art precisely because it more fully models art using the technology of computing.</p>

<p>AARON’s development is historically authentic given its historical environment. To reverse-engineer AARON now is to be an Impressionist in the 1920s, or a surrealist in the 1970s. At best it is to make woodcuts in the 1910s, or to re-make the Large Glass in the 1960s.</p>

<p>This is a criticism of my current projects. I would answer it with reference to Liu and to Art &amp; Language: inconvenient history and genres are at least potentially resistant to the dominant paradigm of corporate knowledge culture. And AARON is very inconvenient history, paradigmatic software with irreducible aesthetic content that outperforms corporate exploitations of the same technology.</p>

<p>But AARON’s history is not my history (despite us both being born around the same time), and its historical environment and resources are not those of today. Contemporary computing is the social graph and dataset clouds of Web 2.0 . The crowdsourcing of “The Sheep Market” is exemplary within this environment and against the backdrop of relational art’s service-economy-that-protests-too-much. So is Casey Reas’s data visualisation, although it lacks the critical potential of the former.</p>

<p>The resources of contemporary computing are the vast data sets of wikipedia, archive.org, etc., and of the distributed processing systems of Amazon and Google. The coding paradigms are Ruby and its Rails framework, Python and Google’s mapreduce, and surprisingly a resurgent Lisp. Reas’s Processing is too neat a solution to too uncritical a position to corporate knowledge culture. It is exemplary, yes, but not critically exemplary, which to be fair it is not intended to be.</p>

<p>The lesson of AARON is that intensifying the aesthetic and significatory core of art using the resources of corporate knowledge culture’s contingent computational technology can provide an immanent critique of both. To be of value, the implications of this lesson must be worked out and through within the indexical environment and with the resources of art and computing for each historical moment. And this must be done as art if not for art’s sake then not for the sake of the efficiency of managerial regard.</p>
