        The Worst Pies In London

    <span class="post-date">27 Jan 2008</span>

    <p>The broadsheets haven’t been kind to Sweeney Todd. The Grauniad bemoaned Tim Burton discarding the play’s critique of capitalism while The Sunday Times was upset that there weren’t any proper tunes in Sondheim’s score. Oh, wait, I got that the wrong way round. The Times wanted more class activism, The Graun wanted something to hum. What is the world coming to?</p>

<p>It’s an excellent film. I found watching it a harrowing experience, as much from its psychological aspects as from the actual close shaves. The violence was a long time in coming as everything slowly fell into place (or possibly apart), and when it finally arrived it was visceral but matter-of fact which made it all the worse. A savage slash and few gurgles and that’s it. Apart from the final scene, which had both a deeper feeling of dread and even worse atrocities pervading it.</p>

<p>The criticism I’ve read of the acting is space filler. Burton got a good performance out of Alan Rickman ferchrissakes, the one that Rickman always feels and that if you were sat in the stalls of a theatre or behind the camera on a set that you would feel but that, like all supernatural auras, usually never quite gets captured by technology. Burton gets Helena Bonhma Carter and Ali G to give performances that go from comic to tragic in the space of a few moments without ever being annoying. And if Johnny Depp doing some unsubtle emoting rather than actually acting would please broadsheet critics then that’s just another reason to ignore them.</p>

<p>I found listening to the film confusing to begin with. It’s The Muses’ revenge on me for every time I have ever been unsympathetic to someone who doesn’t get modern art. The words pole-dance around the music. The music is complex and fleeting. But I got into it, and by the time the worst pies in London were on the table I could find my way around it.</p>

<p>The punchline works thanks to some masterful misdirection of the viewer’s attention, and the film ends at precisely the moment it should. In the soundtrack album notes, Burton mentions Hammer’s horror films as one of his points of inspiration, and I think this is the kind of film the old Hammer would make now. If they did musicals and had Tim Burton as a director.</p>

    <p>After debugging draw-something quite majorly last year and adding the framework for its future development I thought I had captured all the embarrassing bugs (like drawing things twice…). But I’d missed a bug in my random-point-on-line code that generated points off the end of the line. So draw-something was lovingly generating most of the drawing off the edge of the canvas.</p>

<p>Working around this has improved the drawings that draw-something creates, here are two I have selected:</p>

<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/drawing-20080121-233101.png" alt="drawing-20080121-233101.png" /></p>

<p>Now I can start giving draw-something heuristics for deciding what kind of elements should go where, and when.</p>

<blockquote>_In Imagine No Possessions, Christina Kiaer investigates the Russian Constructivist conception of objects as being more than commodities. "Our things in our hands must be equals, comrades," wrote Aleksandr Rodchenko in 1925. Kiaer analyzes this Constructivist counterproposal to capitalism's commodity fetish by examining objects produced by Constructivist artists between 1923 and 1925_</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordances">Wikipedia: Affordances</a></p>

<blockquote>_An affordance is the quality of an object, or an environment, that allows an individual to perform action._</blockquote>

<p>So…</p>

<p>Both state capitalism and neoliberalism have produced devices that are meant to be more than commodity fetishes. Are these just reification, however much academia and the blogosphere may protest to the contrary?</p>

<p>Under the theory of affordances the online social graph is produced through social objects, that is it is afforded by them. Is this reification? Are online social networks themselves hypostatization? Or are they intensification (pace Christine Harold’s <a href="http://www.upress.umn.edu/Books/H/harold_ourspace.html">OurSpace</a>), or just implementation (utilities, to take them at Facebook value)?</p>

<p>If social objects are fetishized/reified they must at most be arcs, not nodes (lines not points). They will be the <em>value</em> of any line that they afford between other nodes. But if they are not fetishized/reified then they <em>could</em> be represented as nodes/points, with the lines they afford more clearly identifying that they are “comrades”, peers, or at least mediators.</p>

<p>Constructivist and technogeek objects, objects as comrades or social drivers, are affordative objects. They are morphisms on the social category. To avoid the “what is art” equivalent question for this we can declare all objects socially affordative and then ask which are better at it. Is an iPhone really a better socially affordance than a cup of coffee? Is a Facebook widget really a better way of making links really or virtually than meeting for a realtime conversation?</p>

<p>Online social networks would at most be events or contexts in a sociologist’s Social Network Analysis matrix. Would the telephone get a row, or a lonely hearts column? What kind of theory of society would that illustrate? What kind of theory of society would it illustrate if between Mrs Ingram and Mr Ippolito there was a column marked “iPhone”? And would every iPhone get its own column? Or everyone’s Facebook usage its own column? If not, why not?</p>

<p>Looking back into the history of ideas can expand the frames of reference that contemporary phenomena are considered in relation to. And applying contemporary sociological and mathematical concepts to social networks and affordative devices will be very fruitful. The problems of classifying relationships and of measuring relations in large populations were faced a long time ago in sociology but have just started to be of interest to bloggers encountering the iPhone. Treating social networks as sets, categories, topographies or graphs affords (fnarr) all kinds of analytical and philosophical tools.</p>

    <p>It’s rare I encounter a term I can neither unpack nor Google.</p>

<p>So does anyone know what a “constitutive blank” is? I assume it’s Theory jargon borrowed from somewhere.</p>
