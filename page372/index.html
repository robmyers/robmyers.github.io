        Require Attribution, Allow Commercial, Share

    <span class="post-date">22 Nov 2003</span>

    <p>I will be licensing most of my art back catalogue and new work under a Creative Commons license. For obvious reasons I will not license work that is derived from found images. I will also not license work that is not easily edited or sampled, or commissioned work if requested not to. I will provide graphic units, palettes and preparatory work as well as finished work where possible (I’ve been watching a lot of Disney DVDs recently as well as always having enjoyed sketchbooks).</p>

<p>I’m doing this to solve problems of production and distribution that I have always faced with my work, and because I believe that it is culturally worthwhile, indeed that it is the only way for art of any cultural value to go.</p>

<p>The License I’m considering is “Require Attribution, Allow Commercial, Share And Share Alike”. Coincidentally I believe this to be the closest to the GPL.</p>

<p>“Require Attribution” because this adds value for me in terms of publicity, contact and feedback.</p>

<p>“Allow Commercial” because this allows other people to get direct value from the work as well. By not precluding any use of the work, commercial or otherwise, this may encourage use of the work, encourage distribution (adding value by Require Attribution), and encourage derived work (ensuring that the value grows).</p>

<p>“Share And Share Alike” because this is what I would like from other people’s work. I’d love to be able to download, photograph, sketch or copy people’s work, take the idea and run with it (“plussing” to use a Disney term) without the yawn-inducing politics of appropriation. As more and more people start plussing thanks to open art, more and more work will be created that builds on the work of others, growing value rather than extracting it by stunting or duplicating forgotten art from a generation ago.</p>

    <span class="post-date">21 Nov 2003</span>

    <p><strong>What?</strong><br />
Minara is “Emacs for graphics”, a programmable vector graphics program editor written using libArt, libSDL and librep. Read that again slowly. :-) This is that “tinker under the hood, write your own tools” environment you’ve always heard about.</p>

<p>Minara is a program that can render graphics descriptions, and allows the user to modify those descriptions using scripts in the <em>same</em> language. The descriptions and the modifications are all written in a very simple data format / programming language which interfaces with the graphics and UI engine. This enables artists, researchers, reprographics operators, brand designers and many other groups to create generative, dynamic, generic and/or shareable artwork in a format that can easily be converted to standards such as EPS, SVG or Flash.</p>

<p><strong>Why?</strong><br />
Most graphics formats are already programming languages or contain programmable elements (PostScript, SVG, Flash). The only major non-programmable graphics format is PDF, which was intentionally designed as a static subset of PostScript. Most graphics programs are scriptable. Editors such as Illustrator and iDraw have scripting languages. But these are in a different language from the graphics description language, and with varying access to the underlying data structures. There’s nothing that is code all the way down or that can be freely extended or modified by user scripting.</p>

<p>An environment that allows the user to write graphics code, generative code, analysis code and processing code all in the same language using the same tools within an illustration program with open code, open APIs and no barriers between content and process will enable greater creativity (and productivity).</p>

<p>A common data format that allows dynamic, generic or richly described content and that doesn’t suck will allow archive-quality (“bitfast”) graphics to be exchanged in open content projects and corporate workflows.</p>

<p><strong>Who and When?</strong><br />
Me to start with, then anyone else who’s interested. At some point in the future.</p>

    <p>Digging through my archives I found an unfinished license drafted for an abandoned project from 2001 which I present here for your amusement. It’s inspired by the BSD and OGL licenses. IANAL so don’t try to actually use it - you wouldn’t try to use heart transplant instructions written by an artist would you? :-)<br />

        Successful Open Source Art
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">16 Nov 2003</span>

    <p>Successful open source software projects tackle well-defined tasks<br />
with a sense of shared purpose, good acceptance criteria and good<br />
public rewards. Open source art projects need to be the same. Just<br />
setting up a CVS server or studio and letting people walk in won’t get<br />
anywhere (although such resources will be needed). A show theme, a<br />
mural/installation/public art call or other focus is what is<br />
required. And a good firewall to prevent trolls sabotaging the work.</p>

<p>A good example of a small but practical open source <em>design</em><br />
project is the SVG Flag repository.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gnomedesktop.org/article.php?sid=1421">SVG Flag Repository article</a></p>

<p>The flags are actually in the public domain. An equivalent artistic<br />
project might be a library of motifs or graphical elements. Perhaps<br />
colour schemes, compositions or compositional elements, images to be<br />
modified or sampled. Set a theme each month and let people vote for<br />
the best.</p>

<p>Themes for the Linux desktop projects are open source, and are the<br />
contemporary equivalent of religious art or of still lifes. Religious<br />
art because they are icons of faith (work). Still lifes<br />
because they are objects of regard and show absent wealth<br />
(information). This, rather than the backward “art museums need<br />
something to fill them” of gallery art is the art of the future, but<br />
its Sistine Chapel Ceiling is some way off yet.<br />
