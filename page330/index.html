    <p><a href="http://minara.sourceforge.net/">Minara</a> is sticking with OpenGL; adding an intersection callback stopped the crashes. I’ve cleaned up the buffer and window code, and started working on code to support transforms using PostScript-style matrices for speed (2x3 rather than 3x3). You can also save buffers now (type x,s). The C cleanup can wait. I need to think some more about transforms, and also about dialog-style interactions with the user. Minara needs to prompt for filenames and to display colour choices and other dialog functionality. I don’t want to reinvent the wheel, but I do want something that will look good and be fast for power-users to operate.</p>

    <p><a href="http://three.org/openart/">The Open Art License</a><a href="http://artlibre.org/licence.php/lalgb.html"> </a>, by the <a href="http://three.org/openart/">Open Art Network</a>. I don’t think we need another art license. If people want a GPL-style license for art, one that requires that sources be provided, they should probably just use the GPL. <a href="http://www.gnuart.org/">GnuArt</a> do this. If you don’t want to provide sources, the <a href="http://www.creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> licenses are best. There have been other attempts at art licenses. The <a href="http://artlibre.org/licence.php/lalgb.html">Free Art License</a> has been out for a while now, and I drafted (but fortunately never used) a <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/robmyers/weblog/C1592552572/E436023289/index.html">BSD-style art license</a> a few years back.</p>

<p>Let’s not divide culture up into little content ghettos around strangely similar yet strangely incompatible licenses.</p>

        A Hacker Manifesto
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">10 Dec 2004</span>

    <p>Interesting new book on a principle I’ve been talking about for a while:[</p>

<p>A Hacker Manifesto](ttp://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog/WARHAC.html)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.eyebeam.org/reblog/archives/2004/11/review_of_a_hacker_manifesto.html">Eyebeam</a> ask how you can write a manifesto for a movement you’re not part of, and whether Eric Raymond hasn’t already said everything on the subject.</p>

<p>The book is an outsider’s application of the hacker ethic to broader social and economic concerns than just writing software. It is not addressed to the existing hacker crowd. So it’s not a manifesto for a movement the writer is not part of, rather it’s someone bringing that movement’s content to the attention of a wider audience. That is to be applauded.</p>

<p>Eric Raymond’s main contribution to hacker culture has been watering down the ideology of Free Software to appeal to incumbent corporate interests. He doesn’t understand how cathedrals were built (as multi-generational, iterative realisations of a vision rather than as micro-managed waterfall projects), and the problems he has with current “"”open source””” are <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/robmyers/weblog/C1592552572/E276038713/index.html">a product of the flaws in his own arguments</a>.</p>

    <p>I drew the images for 1969 in red and blue peel-off china marker in an A5 sketchbook, then used the images as reference to assemble the layout for images from nuclear fallout diagrams that I’d traced by hand for 1968. Those images were in tints of primary red or green.<br />
I copied and pasted those to their own file, added background colours, and coloured the contours with reference to a Pantone flipbook. The colours were red and blue (for political reasons), green and muted hues for landscape, pink for classical flesh, and other colours as they took my fancy. <br />
At some point I switched from Illustrator 6 to Illustrator CS. After leaving things a few days I discarded about a dozen images I didn’t feel were quite good enough. After a couple of weeks I discarded a few more, bitmapped the images by hand, and ran two scripts to make the various vector formats and the HTML for the images.</p>

    <p>After upgrading to Illustrator CS I checked on <a href="http://www.scriptographer.com/">Scriptographer</a>, the excellent interactive scripting tool for Illustrator. Yes, there’s now a CS version.</p>
