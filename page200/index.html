    <p>(via <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/">Boing Boing</a>) <a href="http://www.aswarmofangels.com/about/">A Swarm of Angels</a>_ You can help invent the future of film by joining the Swarm in creating a Â£1 million pound film and giving it away to over one million people in one year.<em>Right. I’ve learnt my lesson about this, so I’m phrasing it as a question:Why is this going to be placed under a _NonCommercial</em> sharealike licence? The Orange project’s film, Elephants Dream, was released without that limitation, and it was paid for using the street performer protocol as well.If people are paying Â£25 and working on the film, why should they not get the rights to exploit their film commercially? This is what NC means, that the people who pay for and work on this film are excluded from it in a way that the film’s organiser isn’t.Is there a good legal or organisational reason for this, is it just commercial=bad, or is it trying to prevent the people who pay for the film from being ripped off? Only the first would make any sense.And I hope the film will be available under a different licence for cinemas, otherwise they won’t be able to charge admission when they show it…</p>

    <p>Imagine a horror film about an insane ventriloquist who believes that his possessed dummy is talking. What he believes the dummy to be saying is not what the dummy is saying. The dummy can appeal to the audience, but the ventriloquist will not understand the audience’s reactions. Especially when the dummy tells the audience that the ventriloquist thinks it wants him to murder his wife.</p>

<p>How can the ventriloquist silence the dummy? Even if he destroys it or exorcises it he will only silence its real voice. He will still hear what he thinks it is saying. And if his insanity is diagnosed and treated after this, he will still be unaware of what he has actually done.</p>

    <p><strong>1</strong></p>

<p>Marie Antoinette was not French by birth.</p>

<p>Marie Antoinette did not say “let them eat cake”, and that is a mistranslation anyway.</p>

<p>Marie Antoinette was executed during the French Revolution. She was the last queen of France.</p>

<p><strong>2</strong></p>

<p>Marie Antoinette had a dairy farm where she acted out the fantasy of being a milkmaid. She did not milk the cows, servants took care of that. They also made sure that the farm was kept spotlessly clean and that the animals were sweetly perfumed.</p>

<p>The spectacle of social virtue even in uneducated agricultural labourers is the genre content of the Pastoral. This bucolic sentimentality is a lullaby of social order even in those with least to gain from society, in this case the social order of a monarch who would later lose her head at the hands of the unwashed. Marie Antoinette’s milkmaid fantasy was Pastoral as consumed experience rather than as viewed image or read text.</p>

<p>The experiences and relations of agricultural labourers stripped of necessity or untidiness and then aestheticised are - what exactly? Remove the power and satisfaction of the monarch from the equation and you have inept wannabe agricultural labourers who don’t actually wannabe agricultural labourers. This must have filled a few spare afternoons but it told those who took part in it very little about country life, and nothing that they didn’t want to hear.</p>
