<p>My contribution to the book is a greatly expanded version of the most popular post from this blog, “Open Source Art Again”, with additional quotations and references. I’ve seen one of the other contributions and I know several of the other contributors so I can say without being arrogant that I know there’s going to be some very good stuff in this book.</p>

        The Agile Artist 3 - Getting Real
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">13 Oct 2008</span>

    <p>“<a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/">Getting Real</a>” is 37 Signals’ book of advice for developing internet software more quickly, more easily, and more successfully. As with “Getting Things Done”, this may not at first sound particularly relevant for making art. But Getting Real’s approach to projects is a very dynamic and creative one, and even if not all of its details are appropriate for art making (or for every artist), there’s lots of good ideas if you take the time to map them onto art practice.</p>

<p>To pick a few section headings…</p>

<p>I always <a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch02_Whats_Your_Problem.php">try to solve my own problems</a> in art, I can never get enthusiastic about art for an external agenda. I usually <a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch02_Have_an_Enemy.php">pick a fight </a>when<br />
making art, many of my series of works are ironizations of worldviews I<br />
disagree with or of artists whose work I dislike. I try to <a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch06_Race_to_Running_Software.php">get at least one piece in a series finished as soon as possible</a> to keep up my morale. I <a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch12_Free_Samples.php">give samples away for free</a><br />
with images of work available on the website and as postcards and other<br />
physical items available from me in person. And I always try to give<br />
series of works <a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch13_Name_Hook.php">memorable names</a>.</p>

<p>Just read “art” for “software” and “studio” for “organization” and much of it makes sense, or is at least thought provoking. The chapters on “Staffing”, “Code”, “Interface Design” and “Words” won’t be relevant. Do surprise me in the comments, though… ;-) .</p>

        Value In The Work
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">07 Oct 2008</span>

    <p>Damien Hirst’s diamond skull “For The Love Of God”, 2007, is owned fractionally by Hirst, his dealer and an anonymous investment group. As the monetary value of the work rises and falls, the value of the fraction of it owned by each investor in the work will rise and fall with it. Their values have proportion and relations.</p>

<p>It’s possible to imagine short selling, leveraging and other financial abstractions and transformations being applied to this value. The fact of their application might affect the monetary value of the work. And the monetary value of the work is in no small way part of the work aesthetically. The economics of the work reach into its aesthetics.</p>

<p>Ashley Bickerton’s “Le Art (Composition with Logos 2)”, 1987, is covered with a number of corporate logos. The recognizability and relevance of the logos is part of the aesthetics of the work. The work will change as the fortunes of the companies or their logos vary.</p>

<p>With both Hirst’s work and Bickerton’s there is still a physical artwork as the ground for the financial figures of the aesthetics of the piece. As with relational art, a more thorough dematerialization of the artwork (a greater primacy for its gross ideological rather than aesthetic principles) might require a greater physicality. Rather than a work of pure economic figures, the ground of a flea market (or its haute couture equivalent, an auction house) might be required.</p>

    <p>If you have directories containing SVG files that you wish to add to a Subversion repository and you wish them to display as images rather than XML when someone broswes the repository in a web broswer, run the following in the local parent directory then commit it:</p>

<p>svn propset svn:mime-type image/svg+xml <em>/</em>.svg</p>

        The Agile Artist 2 - Web 2.0 Productivity
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">06 Oct 2008</span>

    <p>There are many Web 2,0 sites that allow you to organize projects using Wikis, checklists of to-do items, calendars and other systems. These can be of use to artists.</p>

<p>37 Signals are the leaders in this area but their work is not Free Software so I recommend <a href="http://www.joyent.com/connector">Joyent’s Connector</a> and <a href="http://www.wikidot.com/">Wikidot instead,</a> or even better software installed on your own server.</p>

<p>Two posts from 37 Signals’s blog illusttrate how to use Web 2.0 productivity services to help organize art practice.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/1226-how-to-manage-long-breaks-in-your-software-side-projects">http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/1226-how-to-manage-long-breaks-in-your-software-side-projects</a></p>

<p>Use a todo/checklist service to remind you of ideas you have yet to try or tasks that you need to complete for a project. Then when you return to the project after an interruption you can quickly remind yourself of what needs doing.</p>

<p>[http://37signals.blogs.com/products/2008/08/backpack-helps.html</p>

<p>](http://37signals.blogs.com/products/2008/08/backpack-helps.html)Use a wiki-style service to gather research materials such as images, references and notes for a project.</p>

<p>Although these examples are for software develoment and an academic research respectively it is easy to see how their lessons can be used to help organize art porjects.</p>
