<blockquote>_My band, furny, have released all the tracks from our two EPs as free downloads. They've been available elsewhere, including Last.fm and for sale as CDs for a while.  
  
We're putting them all up on the web and encouraging people to download, listen and if they like.. donate.  
  
I don't expect many people will donate, but I do hope a lot of people will download them. We're encouraging people to file share them, and even to make their own CDs and sell them, for profit, and not share that money with us.  
  
Why? Because it's all great publicity.  
  
Want to make your own furny t-shirts and sell them? Great Let us know.. we'll link to you  
  
Want to make your own furny CDs and sell them in your record store, or online store? Fantastic.  
  
Using furny music in your game, or movie? Awesome  
  
We're even including a bundle of someone else's artwork in each download -- with 1999-2005 EP you get CC Ironies and with more mature escapades in hi-fi, you get Canto -- both of these by Rob Myers, a friend of the band after he wrote a nice little write up on our licensing._</blockquote>

<blockquote>_Artist Fiddian Warman built some robots controlled by a neural network. neural networks can learn, so he's been playing them classic punk records in an attempt to turn them into robotic versions of his younger self. the robots are 2 metres tall and have the ability to pogo. It all culminates in a gig at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London 3-5 July 2008: bring your friends_</blockquote>

<p>This should be good.</p>

<p>(Disclosure: I was at the Centre For Electronic Arts with Fiddian, I was also briefly in SoDA with him, and he’s great.)</p>

<p>Or was in 1991. I used to make my way there to get fractal stuff in the early 1990s. Well, it was generally 2 or 3 dimensional, but it had images of fractals on it. I never got any of the music. I must try to find some.</p>

<p>I’ve a soft spot for fractals. I’ll write about why another time.</p>

    <p>As well as destroying proprietary implementations, VRML 2 has resisted full implementation by Free Software projects for over a decade. That’s no mean feat.</p>

<p>There are no VRML plugins in Ubuntu (my current distro) at present. So I downloaded a copy of FreeWrl and installed that. After working out how to actually get Firefox to take notice of it<del> I found that the plugin’s menus draw behind its drawing area and </del>(Update: This was a problem with the window compositor, not FreeWrl. Uninstalling Compiz fixed this. that those worlds I could get it to draw it didn’t seem to place the camera in properly.</p>

<p>I then downloaded the source for OpenVrml. After several hours of building and the same plugin installation dance as FreeWrl I found that it just jammed on the worlds I looked at.</p>

<p>I wish both projects well, and I’m sure they work well with the worlds they are designed to render, but they are a dead loss for just getting on with browsing web 3D. I’ll see if I can dig out some of my old worlds to try them on.</p>

<p>Crosbie (in the comments) recommends OpenCroquet, which I am downloading. And I am installing the Microsoft anti-Free Software timebomb that is Mono in order to run OpenSim and try Free Software Second Life networking.</p>

<p>But I still just want a VRML browser plugin that just works.</p>
