    <span class="post-date">22 May 2004</span>

    <p>I’ve finished most of the object picking code I need so far, just line and curve intersection to do (these are well-known standard algorithms. The curve one I’ll implement in C for speed). They’ll be as sloooow as I expected: rendering the scene to find where the graphics are under the mouse then doing a text search of the image source to find this point in the program is insanely inefficient. And how we’ll handle symbols and functions I don’t know (keep hashtables of each and have some sort of lookup scheme, probably, with the user responsible for writing picking versions of functions as a worst case).</p>

<p>I’m doing less well with colour. I’ve got LittleCMS, but the idea of having colour primaries as gamut-limit XYZA tuples means that gamut checking hopefully isn’t a problem. What LCMS could be useful for is mapping the abstract percentage of the colour to the actual strength of colour on the screen or the press, which won’t be linear. But I don’t know if I want to do that just yet.</p>

<p>How do we do colour picking? Make an image with percentages of each of the primaries in, display that, and update the mix when the user clicks, accepting when they double click. Who needs GUI widgets? :-)</p>

    <p>“1968” needs finishing. It’s colour that’s the problem. I want a more fluid and accurate way of working with colour than the current crop of illustration software gives me.<br />
Minara needs continuing. it needs real tasks and projects to work on.<br />
So I’m going to write the bits of Minara I need to edit “1968”. Defining colours, managing colour accuracy, and possibly hit-testing will all be needed. I’ll also have to make sure the import filter works well to convert 1968 to minara format.<br />
In software engineering jargon this is known as “eating your own dog food”. Yum.</p>

    <p>The unelected European Commision, under the Microsoft-sponsored Irish presidency, has voted in favour of software patents. This is despite the European commission (the elected government) voting against them<br />
Software patents sound like they protect people’s ideas but they don’t. They stifle competition, reduce choice and as more and more of our business and culture becomes digital, they impose a burden of cost and control on our day-to-day lives.<br />
See FFII for what we can still do to stop this idiocy.</p>

        The Ontology For “Draw Something”
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">16 May 2004</span>

    <p>I’ve started working on the ontology for my program “Draw Something”. It’s currently based on my unpublished “ae” toy aesthetic program, but I need something heavier duty for the full program.<br />
In computing an ontology is data that represents knowledge, particularly facts and rules. So for a medical program, the ontology would contain information about which drugs treat which conditions, and how those drugs interact. In philosophy, ontology is the metaphysics of being and categories of being. Both meanings are applicable to Draw Something’s ontology; it’s a computer representation of an investigation into what art is and how you produce art-objects.<br />
I have a certain way I want Draw Something’s ontology to work - more as active “daemons” than as passive symbols. I’ve been looking at Paul Graham’s writing on “closures” in his book “<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/onlisp.html">On Lisp</a>”. Closures combine data and instructions in a more active way than other programming techniques do, but I’m not sure they’re what I need (in particular I don’t know how to copy closures in a program or get polymorphic behaviour from them). And very few people understand closures. And I’m not really one of them yet. :-)<br />
My favourite type of ontology is Douglas Hofstadter’s slipnet, as seen in his &amp; Melanie Mitchell’s “<a href="http://www.cse.ogi.edu/~mm/how-to-get-copycat.html">CopyCat</a>” program, explained in “<a href="http://www.cogsci.indiana.edu/fcca.html">Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies</a>”. A slipnet allows more specific ideas (“the number 5”) to be generalised to less specific ideas (“numbers”) if the a particular problem cannot be solved with more specific ideas. Copycat also has a nice split between its built-in concepts and its current working memory. Hopefully this will be a useful model to use for Draw Something.</p>
