    <p>After reading the excellent “Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming” by Peter Norvig, I’ve started on a toy re-implementation of Harold Cohen’s AARON. It’s based on AARON circa 1978, so it’s production-system and pixel based, but in Lisp rather than C. After some deliberation I’ve named it Ben, which follows AARON alphabetically, and is smaller.</p>

<p>Here’s a test of the current version:</p>

<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/cells.png" alt="cells.png" /></p>

<p>This isn’t a replacement for draw-something, which is inspired by AARON but very different both in terms of how it’s programmed and the images it produces.</p>

    <p><strong>Scene:</strong> A bank boardroom somewhere in the North of England. Eight bored-looking old men are sat around an oval table.</p>

<p>A sharply-dressed young MBA walks in, opens his laptop, and connects it to the video projector currently throwing a silent re-enactment of Derek Jarman’s ‘Blue’ onto the wall. A powerpoint slide flickers into view.</p>

<p><strong>MBA:</strong> Right guys, so what we’re looking at here is the increase in the bank’s monetarizably leveragible resourcary instances this year. This is an annuitized fiscalistic product, a complex of offset and re-contextualized future elements with contingencies virtualized and re-incorporated. Now if you remember, my incentivisatory package stipulates that I will get a million pounds for every 100% increase in profits, so five million pounds are being wired to my account as we speak.</p>

<p><strong>Old Man 1:</strong> I didn’t understand a word of that, so it must be good.</p>

<p><strong>Old Man 2:</strong> And of course we get bonuses based on this as well.</p>

<p><strong>Old Man 3:</strong> Wonderful. So let’s see the projections for next year.</p>

<p><strong>MBA:</strong> The what?</p>

<p><strong>Old Man 3:</strong> The projections. For next year.</p>

<p><strong>MBA:</strong> Oh I see. Nope, I don’t have any.</p>

<p><strong>Old Man 4:</strong> You don’t have any idea how the business will increase next year?</p>

<p><strong>MBA:</strong> Look, you said to me “grow the revenue streams this year” and I have. It’s a bit late to start worrying about what you are going to do next year now!</p>

<p><strong>Old Man 5:</strong> What do you mean?</p>

<p><strong>MBA:</strong> Well I’ve just lent seventy billion pounds worth of mortgages to idiots who couldn’t afford to repay them if they sold their kidneys to Gordon Ramsey! How else do you think I got the arrangement fees so high!</p>

<p><strong>Old Man 6:</strong> Ohhhhh…</p>

<p><strong>MBA:</strong> Next year. Pffff.</p>

<p><strong>Old Man 7:</strong> So, young man, how did you get the money for these mortgages?</p>

<p><strong>MBA:</strong> Oh I borrowed it. Don’t worry, it’s only short-term loans so it won’t show up on the books as a long-term commitment and depress the share price.</p>

<p><strong>Old Man 8:</strong> And what happens when these short-term loans expire?</p>

<p><strong>MBA:</strong> Well that doesn’t happen until next year. So it really isn’t part of my remit.</p>

<p><strong>Old Man 3:</strong> So what you are telling us is that you have caused this bank to take on a hundred and forty billion dollars of short term loans in order to get the arrangement fees from selling mortgages to people who cannot possibly afford to repay them?</p>

<p><strong>MBA:</strong> Absolutimondo.</p>

<p><strong>Old Man 3:</strong> And you did this because you would get a bonus based on poorly chosen short-term indicators?</p>

<p><strong>MBA:</strong> Booyakashan!</p>

<p><strong>Old Man 3:</strong> Without any consideration that this might destroy not just this company but the wider economy?</p>

<p><strong>MBA:</strong> Kapow!</p>

<p><strong>Old Man 3:</strong> You do know you shouldn’t have done that…</p>

<p><strong>MBA:</strong> Pfff. Based on which principle of microeconomics?</p>

<blockquote>_Michael Takeo Magruder is portraying this landscape of digital memory with its own tools, producing portraits of its inhabitants with its own palettes. In Addressable Memory the first draft of history is allegorized as a process of combining and quantizing disparate experience and telemetry. Of mashing-up and composing. The technology and aesthetics of mobile phones, Internet news feeds, video screens, computer image processing and virtual reality are all turned on themselves. At TheSpace4 in Peterborough this show takes up all three rooms. It will be touring the UK throughout 2008._</blockquote>

        Remix Affordances
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">27 Jan 2008</span>

    <p>A question someone recently asked about Where Are The Joneses (WRTJ) could be rephrased as “where were the remix affordances?”</p>

<p>WRTJ was structured as a TV-style situation comedy, albeit one running in three minute segments. The affordances for altering it were external to the episodes and came before the fact. You could create the plot, or write yourself or your radio station or your home into the episodes when they were on the wiki before they were filmed. As a participatory production project this was unprecedented. But after the episodes were filmed their forms were fixed and closed off. They weren’t particularly structured to provide affordances for remixing or mashing-up or extending.</p>

<p>Conversation Agent talks about <a href="http://www.conversationagent.com/2008/01/the-role-of-the.html">traditional media starting to optimize their stories for search engines</a>. Video search isn’t practical at the moment, so WRTJ couldn’t be structured optimally for search. But it could have been structured more optimally for remixing. Remixing produces searchable or discoverable material that leads back to the original project and hence to the project sponsor. Remix optimizing is therefore a form of search optimization. It is also of value culturally in itself as it provides more creative affordances to society.</p>

<p>Affordances must be perceptible. You must be able to see that you could use them, and be able to have some kind of idea what you can do with them. And they must allow or enable some action that would not be possible without them. For an episodic comedy project this would be adding to or altering each episode.</p>

<p>So here are some initial suggestions for how future Joneses-style projects could optimize for remix, some drawn from WRTJ and some from considering viral and franchise media:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Provide source. Give people more material to remix and to produce alternative versions. Give people the information they need to know about locations and props. Share as much of the planning and design process as possible.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Provide hooks. Every episode should provide plot or setting hooks, characters, and visual material for extension, recontextualization and response.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Provide gaps. Fades, pauses, quiet moments. Anything other content could be inserted into.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Provide elements. Catch-phrases, askew looks, funny moments. Anything that can be decontextualized and spliced into a flow of other moments.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Provide extensible arcs. Running jokes or plotlines that can run on elsewhere.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Provide calls. Anything people can respond to and be seen to be responding to.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Hooks, gaps and arcs would work in franchise media (like Star Trek). Source, gaps, elements and calls work for mash-ups and responses.</p>

<p>These are designed to enable and encourage everything from blipvert-style remixes of different media to inclusion in other series and fan responses. And to be seen to enable and encourage them.This isn’t a complete list of strategies, it’s just an initial consideration of what I think is an important idea.</p>
