    <p>If you want a USB memory key for something other than windows, don’t buy a Discgo Classic. They have some crapware called U3 on that will get in your way and deny several megs of the disk’s space to you on Linux and Mac at the hardware level.There’s an uninstaller, but it only works on Windows. Despite the packaging claiming Mac and Linux compatibility.Who at Discgo was stupid enough to think that this adds value?</p>

        Why The New Colouring Algorithm Works
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">20 Feb 2007</span>

    <p>AARON’s new colouring algorithm works very well, as Harold Cohen said when he described it. What he didn’t go into was why.</p>

<p>I think the algorithm works well because it is a good model of the cognition of our perception, which is in turn a good set of heuristics for coping with sensory data coming from our environment.</p>

<p>Constraining the contrast (the saturation and brightness) to a few ranges reflects the fact that we usually only have to deal with a few different levels of lighting at the same time (for example when going into or coming out of forest, or when the sun is breaking through the clouds).</p>

<p>Limiting the number of colour components to seven each matches the soft limit of our working memory. Whether this is relevent to the vision centre of our brain I couldn’t say, but when we are considering a composition artistically we need a manageable complexity to the hues that it uses.</p>

<p>Producing values that have been structured to fall into ranges that we are neurally predisposed to appreciate may seem like cheating for an artistic program. But in a human this would be called skill, whether that human could account for it or, like AARON, they could not.</p>

        Think Of The Children

    <p>This just in:</p>

<blockquote>_Microsoft have announced that they will be producing a version of Vista for XO, the One Laptop Per Child Project laptop. Each system will be tied to the Windows Genuine Advantage program through a Trusted Computing module on its circuit board to ensure that only licensed systems can run._  
  
_Opponents of this scheme point out that training millions of children to accept permission computing in this way is a subversion of the project's educational mission and a betrayal of its previously espoused exploratory ethos. But a Microsoft spokesperson claimed that this was for the children's own good, and that otherwise people might steal XO laptops for use in businesses that would otherwise buy full Vista licenses. Nobody was available from the Free Software Foundation to comment on this latest manifestation of "Treacherous Computing" before this article was due to go to press. _</blockquote>

<p>OK, I’m lying. Microsoft haven’t said any of this. No XOs will locked to  Windows. No XOs will be tied to WGA.</p>

<p>The people who locking the XO hardware and tying it to a key server system are the OLPC project themselves.</p>

<p>Don’t worry, the trusted computing -er the Bitfrost system- will be removable if you have the trusted keys for the BIOS. And systems in low-bandwidth regions will have very long leases from the key server.</p>

<p>All that remains is to work out how to prevent criminals from reverse-engineering the key server like they have for WGA, stealing the keys for the hardware like they have for every other DRM system ever devised, finding out how long the leases are and stealing a new laptop on the first of the month, or borrowing their kid’s XO in the evening. Compared to creating a new trusted computing security model that suffers from none of the disadvantages of other such systems these are trivial tasks, and should be easy to accomplish in time for the XO’s launch.</p>

    <p>**Stage One **</p>

<ol>
  <li>Generate a number of points within the image bounding box.</li>
  <li>Force some points to be on the bounds.<br />
Modify the current figure form generation system to choose from these points.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Stage Two</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Generate lines by joining the points.<br />
Modify the figure form generation system to choose from these lines.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Stage Three</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Subdivide some of the lines.</li>
  <li>Split some of the overlapping lines.</li>
</ol>

<p>Alternatively create the hull or polygon for the figure and generate forms within it using points on the border, lines between them, and various subdivisions.</p>

<p><strong>Stage Four</strong></p>

<p>Implement various algorithms for consuming the lines and points. From back to front, most simplifying to most simple:</p>

<p>Voronoi or region growing. (Use a flat coloured plane sometimes.<br />
Convex hull.</p>

<p>Closed polygon.</p>

<p>Open polygon.</p>

<p>Line set.</p>

<p>Polyline.</p>

<p>Line.</p>

<p>Point.</p>

<p>Don’t use every technique in every drawing. Increase tightness of line following from back to front. Colour by plane.</p>
