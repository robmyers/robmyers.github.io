        What Is Art?
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">03 May 2003</span>

    <p>I asked ThoughtTreasure (a natural language/commonsense system):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>what is art?</p>

  <p>ENG art; fine art;<br />
ANT: ENG art; fine art;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An art is a sort of media object. Sorts of arts: architecture, the American<br />
art, the comic strip, the drawing, the graffiti, the museum piece, the Oriental<br />
art, the painting, the performance art, the photograph, the picture, the<br />
sculpture, and the watercolor. Other types of media objects: hypermedias, the<br />
advertisement, the broadcast, the computer program, the dance, the datafeed,<br />
the film, the genetic code, the mail, the message, the opera, the part of film,<br />
the part of text, the part of theory, the play, the protocol, the script, the<br />
station, the text, the theory, and the video.</p>

<p>An art is a R2 of a leisure activity. Artist creates an art. A museum visit is<br />
a company relation of an art.</p>

        The Condition Of Design

    <span class="post-date">01 May 2003</span>

    <p>It is not art that is weakened as it approaches the condition of design. It is the power of criticism. All art is design: a competent aesthetic response to a set of isomorphic demands.</p>

    <p>(Figurative) drawing and programming are both about structuring perceptions in-keeping with representational schemes to enable engaging with subjects. Competent drawing is regarded as technically conservative. Which is ridiculous given that the last fifty years have seen drawing used more than ever before. Animation, computer games, graphic design, movies and web/UI design all use drawing as part of their design process. Programming must also be technically conservative, which means that “technically conservative” is a weak and suspect label.</p>

        Bitfastness 2

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">29 Apr 2003</span>

    <p>Data-driven programming allows a lot of the work to be moved from the code to support files. This makes programs easier to maintain and re-implement, and so more bitfast. Lispers claim Lisp is a file-format as well as a language (S-Expressions), and ontologies are often expressed in Prolog. A language that is a way of structuring data might be ideal.<br />
Pseudocode listings, or implementations in languages simple enough to read as pseudocode (Lua) would also be robust. Harold Cohen’s verbal descriptions of AARON’s production systems would allow re-implementation in any programming language, but some accuracy would be lost without the supporting data.</p>
