        Blogs, Quotes and CC

    <p>It is a truth universally acknowledged that a Creative Commons licenced blog that quotes other sources is not placing them under a CC licence.</p>

<p>It is also a fairly well known fact that most blog reader don’t understand this any better than they understand any of the rest of copyright law.</p>

<p>So I believe that blogs that quote often should say something like “Original content under a CC licence” or “My writing under a CC licence”. Like this one used to and will again when I fix it.</p>

<p>This would stop people, say, copying an Ursula K Le Guin story believing it is CC licenced.</p>

<p>It wouldn’t stop them copying it under the four-step Fair Use system of course, but that is a different matter.</p>

    <p>I am trying to add some pages to this blog but they are not showing up.</p>

<p>For example: <a href="/weblog/free-culture-greatest-hits/">/weblog/free-culture-greatest-hits/</a></p>

<p>Is there something I need to do to my blog or web server settings, could this be a plugin acting up, or is it likely that I’ve misconfigured something somewhere?</p>

<p>Any help gratefully received.</p>

        The Red Krayola With Art & Language - Sighs Trapped By Liars
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">12 Oct 2007</span>

    <p>Art and Language wrote lyrics that The Red Krayola (nee Crayola) set to music for three albums in the 1970s and 1980s. After a gap of more than twenty years they have got together again a fourth time for “Sighs Trapped By Liars”.</p>

<p>The album has a summery psychedelic rock sound that is very contemporary in its smooth retro feel. The songs are about mirrors, the authors of “Art Since 1900”, economic and social anecdotes and the texts of various Art &amp; Language artworks. The lyrics, written by the two male artists of Art &amp; Language, are delivered by two female vocalists, continuing the mirroring theme.</p>

<p>The sleeve notes mercifully contain brief explanations of the lyrics as well as the text of the lyrics themselves. These are songs that are deceptively easy on the ear. Their usually laid back feel hides a musical as well as a lyrical bite. Art &amp; Language’s paintings are still texts, and The Red Krayola’s songs are still incisive.</p>

<p>“Four Stars” (about the authors of “Art Since 1900”), “Laughter At The Foot Of The Cross” (about a story by Rabelais), “Hostage” (the text of a series of paintings by A&amp;L;) and the title track are my favourites from an album of thirteen strong tracks.</p>

<p>Sometimes Art &amp; Language’s lyrics and The Red Krayola’s instrumentation are both unstructured enough at the same time that they give neither singers nor listener enough to work with. This can be disorientating, which is presumably the point, but it does rob a good anecdote (“Jerry Fodor’s Story”) of its satisfying conclusion.</p>

<p>You can get the album from any online CD store or on iTunes. I recommend very highly that you do. There are previews on some sites, notably Amazon, so don’t just take my word for it.</p>

        Siouxsie - Mantaray
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">11 Oct 2007</span>

    <p>Siouxsie Sioux has been making music since1977 or so but Mantaray is her first solo album. Her last album with The Creatures, “Hai!”, was marked by meandering lyrics and over-produced vocals. Mantaray is a real return to form with much more focussed songwriting and a clearer voice.</p>

<p>Much has been made in reviews of the personal nature of the lyrics on this album compared to Siouxsie’s work with The Banshees and The Creatures. I’m not sure about that. If songs about bees and oceans are personal then songs about deceptive lovers and new found freedom might be impersonal. The album has all of these.</p>

<p>This is a good album but there are two things I would bemoan. Both are a product of the economics of this album, which seems aimed squarely at the American, probably college radio, market.</p>

<p>The first is Siouxsie’s newly Americanized pronunciation. She slips in and out of ts as ds on the same track and it detracts from the power of the vocals. I love both English and American accents but I prefer one or the other from the same person on the same song and from someone who has sung in the former for so long the latter can be jarring.</p>

<p>The second is the instrumentation. It is slick, polished, soulless content. I can see the producers brainstorming each track: “this one should be punky, this one grungy, this one a torch song”. Siouxsie’s vocals deserve much more than such safe corporate lullabies as backing.</p>

<p>This is a strong enough album that hopefully the next one will give Siouxsie the room to experiment that produced the sound that drew the corporate zombies on the mixing desk to her in the first place.</p>

<p>Compared to past glories this is only as good as Superstition, but much better than Anima Animus. Even just Siouxsie as content would be much, much better than no Siouxsie at all. And this is not just Siouxsie as content. A new found strength indeed…</p>
