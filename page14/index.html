    <p><img src="/assets/2013/12/draw-something-1024x647.png" alt="draw-something" /></p>

<p>A new old version of draw-something is now online.</p>

<p>You can see it (and follow it on tumblr!) here: <a href="http://draw-something-rebooted.tumblr.com/">http://draw-something-rebooted.tumblr.com/</a></p>

<p>draw-something started as a Prolog program called “Got To Start Somewhere”, which described both its algorithm and how I was feeling about art at the time. I quickly switched to Common Lisp, but once one of the earliest versions was working I created an ActionScript port to run online. This was made using a Free Software ActionScript compiler rather than Flash.</p>

<p>I wanted to show draw-something running for a talk <a href="http://paintr-rebooted.tumblr.com/">Jim Andrews</a> invited me to give, and I wanted an excercise in JavaScript, so I ported the ActionScript to node.js and to HTML5 canvas. Doing this and preparing for the talk inspired me to resurrect paintr as well.</p>

<p>It’s such an old version of draw-something that it has a couple of bugs that were later fixed. I fixed the most egregious one but there’s another that will crop up soon, finding it is left as an exercise for the audience. I also re-enabled the skeleton drawing code (the skeleton is the guide figure that draw-something draws around), using non-repro blue instead of the original bright red.</p>

<p>So welcome back draw-something online!</p>

<p>I’ve updated paintr for the 2010s. It’s now implemented in node.js running on OpenShift and posting to tumblr.</p>

<p>paintr’s new address is http://paintr-rebooted.tumblr.com/ .</p>

<p>The images are inline svg, which displays well on the main page and in the individual article pages. If you follow the blog (please do!) the images don’t show in the previews on your dashboard. Clicking through displays the images properly.</p>

<p>I’m wary of using proprietary and cloud web services. In this instance the source code and generated art is available, so it could be rehosted easily.</p>

    <span class="post-date">13 Dec 2013</span>

    <p><img src="/assets/2013/12/FREE_logo_web_small.png" alt="FREE?!" /></p>

<p>I was at Free?! (<a href="http://freeculture.info/">http://freeculture.info/</a>) as a speaker.</p>

<p>The first part of the day was the brunch club:</p>

<p><a href="http://freeculture.info/free-culture-brunch-club/">http://freeculture.info/free-culture-brunch-club/</a></p>

<p>We gathered around tables to discuss various free culture-related topics and write notes on the tablecloths. These were later hung in the gallery upstairs as part of the “(Mis)Interpreting Free Culture Exhibition” art show accompanying the event. The show is excellent, with a wide range of thought-provoking work.</p>

<p><a href="http://freeculture.info/interpreting-free-culture-exhibition/">http://freeculture.info/interpreting-free-culture-exhibition/</a></p>

<p>I was on the “tools” table. We discussed what makes a useful free culture tool, which came down as much to social and community affordances as technical or legal ones. Blender’s community and funding was repeatedly mentioned as a model. During the discussion I encountered some excellent projects I hadn’t heard of before:</p>

<p><a href="http://cargocollective.com/natashaberting/Free-Tool-Galaxy">http://cargocollective.com/natashaberting/Free-Tool-Galaxy</a></p>

<p><a href="https://hotglue.me/">https://hotglue.me/</a></p>

<p>The second part was the Plenary Debate, which brought together some leading free culture film producers to discuss how they made their projects work.</p>

<p><a href="http://freeculture.info/plenary-debate/">http://freeculture.info/plenary-debate/</a></p>

<p>It was refreshing to hear a candid discussion of the frustrations and strengths of crowdfunding approaches based on the long-term experience of the panel members. Jamie King in particular communicated the unpredictability of funding, the harsh statistics of who actually pays for downloads, and the joys of being able to pay artists when they do.
It was also good to see the new Blender short film on a big screen thanks to Ton Roosendaal:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.caminandes.com/">http://www.caminandes.com/</a></p>

<p>The last part of the day was the “Winters Night Copyright Fairytale” event in the evening.</p>

<p><a href="http://freeculture.info/winter-nights-copyright-fairytale/">http://freeculture.info/winter-nights-copyright-fairytale/</a></p>

<p>This brought performances and talks on various free culture themes together with a framing animation and narrative in the form of a fairytale.</p>

<p>With the benefit of hindsight I wish I’d fitted my talks more to the fairytale theme, but I did manage to accidentally fit my slides to its typographic style.</p>

<p>Femke Snelting framed the story with readings from remixed newly out-of-copyright texts by Rabindranath Tagore and Virginia Woolf made using NLTK. Nikita Mazurov’s passion for pirating movies made me wish I could have got to the London Cryptofestival (
<a href="http://www.cryptoparty.in/london_cryptofestival">http://www.cryptoparty.in/london_cryptofestival</a> ) where he was also speaking. Paul Keller’s presentation of the history and possible future direction of Creative Commons gave me a real confidence boost in that organization. And there was much more. The event was recorded and I think it will be online early next year.</p>

<p>The slides from my talks are available here:</p>

<p><a href="https://gitorious.org/robmyers/free-one-day-event/">https://gitorious.org/robmyers/free-one-day-event/</a></p>

<p>Free?! was very much about stepping back and taking stock of Free Culture. I found being reminded (and helping to remind others) of the origins and issues of Free Culture inspiring, and looking seriously at where and how it needs to be rethought invigorating. As a result, I know what I have to do next.</p>

<p>Do have a look at the website if you couldn’t make it to the event.</p>

        Exploring the Tate Collection Metadata
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">06 Nov 2013</span>

    <p>The Tate have released their collection metadata in an exemplary way here:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/tategallery/collection">https://github.com/tategallery/collection</a></p>

<p>Let’s explore it using MongoDB, which you can find installation structions for <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/downloads">here</a>.</p>

<p>First fetch and upload the JSON data:</p>

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/tategallery/collection.git
cd collection
find artists -name *.json -exec perl -p -e 's/\n/ /' '{}' \; -exec echo \; | mongoimport --db tate --collection artists
find artworks -name *.json -exec perl -p -e 's/\n/ /' '{}' \; -exec echo \; | mongoimport --db tate --collection artworks
</code></pre>

<p>Then in the mongo shell we can explore the artists and artworks:</p>

<pre><code>////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Artists
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

// List artist movements

db.artists.aggregate(
{$unwind: "$movements"},
{$project: {name: "$movements.name"}},
{$group: {_id: "movements", items: {$addToSet: "$name"}}}
)

// List artist eras

db.artists.aggregate(
{$unwind: "$movements"},
{$project: {name: "$movements.era.name"}},
{$group: {_id: "movements", items: {$addToSet: "$name"}}}
)

// Find artists by movement

db.artists.find({"movements.name":"Pop Art"})

// Find artists by era

db.artists.find({"movements.era.name":"20th century post-1945"})

// Find artists by birth year

db.artists.aggregate(
{$group: {_id: "$birth.time.startYear", artists: {$addToSet: "$fc"}}}
)

// Find artists by death year

db.artists.aggregate(
{$group: {_id: "$death.time.startYear", artists: {$addToSet: "$fc"}}}
)

// count artists by gender

db.artists.aggregate(
    {$group : {_id : "$gender" , number : {$sum : 1}}},
    {$sort : {number : -1}}
)

// Count artists by birthplace

db.artists.aggregate(
    {$group : {_id : "$birth.place.name" , number : {$sum : 1}}},
    {$sort : {number : -1}}
)

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Artworks
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

// List artwork subject categories

db.artworks.aggregate(
{$unwind: "$subjects.children"},
{$unwind: "$subjects.children.children"},
{$group: {_id: "categories",
           categories: {$addToSet: "$subjects.children.children.name"}}}
)

// List artwork subjects

db.artworks.aggregate(
{$unwind: "$subjects.children"},
{$unwind: "$subjects.children.children"},
{$unwind: "$subjects.children.children.children"},
{$group: {_id: "subjects",
           subjects: {$addToSet: "$subjects.children.children.children.name"}}}
)

// List artwork categorys and subjects

db.artworks.aggregate(
{$unwind: "$subjects.children"},
{$unwind: "$subjects.children.children"},
{$unwind: "$subjects.children.children.children"},
{$group: {_id: "category-subjects",
           subjects: {$addToSet: {category: "$subjects.children.children.name",
                       subject:"$subjects.children.children.children.name"}}}}
)

// List artwork movements

db.artworks.aggregate(
{$unwind: "$movements"},
{$group: {_id: "artwork-movements",
           movements: {$addToSet: "$movements.name"}}}
)

// Find artwork by category/subject group

db.artworks.find({"subjects.children.children.name":"UK counties"})

// Find artwork by subcategory/subject

db.artworks.find({"subjects.children.children.children.name":"beacon"})

// Find artwork by artist name

db.artworks.find({"contributors.fc":"Andy Warhol", "contributors.role":"artist"})

// Find artwork by movement. Will exclude works with no movement.

db.artworks.find({"movements.name":"Pre-Raphaelite"})

// Find artworks without movements

db.artworks.find({"movementCount":0})

// Find artwork by date. Will exclude works with unknown date.

db.artworks.find({"dateRange.startYear": {$gte: 1900, $lt: 1910}})

// Find artworks without dates

db.artworks.find({"dateRange":null})
</code></pre>

<p>Exploring the data it becomes clear that the structure of the metadata is wonderfully regular but some of the content is less so. For example entries in the “artists” data may be attributions to movements rather than individuals, and both movements and individuals may have null gender. Locations in birth and death data can be a town or country name in any language, or a town and country separated by a comma. Not every artwork has a creation date, movements, or subjects.</p>

<p>But this is standard for real-world data, and easy enough to regularise. The community can do this and submit a pull request. What’s important is that this is a high-quality metadata dataset from a world-class art institution. People are already starting to explore and visualise it. See here for a great example:</p>

    <span class="post-date">04 Nov 2013</span>

    <p>You have to feed records into Mongo one per line. Like this:</p>

<pre><code>find artists -name *.json -exec perl -p -e 's/\n/ /' '{}' \; -exec echo \; | mongoimport --db tate --collection artists
find artworks -name *.json -exec perl -p -e 's/\n/ /' '{}' \; -exec echo \; | mongoimport --db tate --collection artworks
