        The Poverty Of Historicism
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">10 Mar 2007</span>

    <p>Popper followed up “The Open Society And Its Enemies” with a critique of Marxism called “The Poverty Of Historicism”. The Historicism of the title is Marxism’s Hegelian spirit of history.</p>

<p>Impersonal, super-human forces such as history or the spirit of the age are bullshit. But at least they are unfalsifiable and incomprehensible bullshit. Markets have no such defence. Their claims are falsifiable, and they are historically tractable.</p>

<p>Markets are bullshit. They are painted as Conway’s Life with pennies but they are fractal smoke-filled rooms. And, oh, the sweetness of the air as we hear about market forces, the logic of the market, the market, the market, the fucking market. The market this, the market that, the market ate my homework. But the market is a human construct.</p>

<p>The poverty of historicism, of Marxism, of Leninism, of Stalinism, of, Gods of all denominations help us, Mao Tse Tsung thought, is the poverty of Marketism. The faithful of the market, marketarians, are the Party Members of carefully constructed legal fictions where the comforting fantasy of the paradise of the invisible hand has been replaced with the comforting fantasy of the unavoidable screwing over of Prisoner’s Dilemma.</p>

<p>That markets appear to work for those they serve is no more here nor there than the benefits of party membership. The smug useful idiocy of the wannabe market rich, of economic libertarians and other hilarious self-flaggelants, is even less to the point.</p>

<p>Markets work in the same way that party membership worked. You cannot blame those whose heads you stand on for not standing on your head anywhere outside of an Escher etching. People need to wake up from the fantasy of markets and soon.</p>

<p>Smithian Hegelism, marketism, is the historicism of The End Of History. The poverty of historicism hasn’t changed, only the trance-words have.</p>

        draw-something: new composition system

    <span class="post-date">06 Mar 2007</span>

    <p>Here’s the first successful image created by the new composition system for draw-something:<br />
<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/drawing-20070306-213107.png" alt="drawing-20070306-213107.png" /></p>

<p>The forms share some vertices because of the new composition system, and their colours relate because of using AARON’s new colouring system. This is the third run of the new code: the first had a bug, the second wasn’t interesting. So there’s more tuning up to do, but this image shows how things will and can work.</p>

        Cello And Digital Delay
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">04 Mar 2007</span>

    <p>I found another MySpace page for someone who uses a cello and a digital delay to make music. If you’re not familiar with digital delays they’re short loop sampler foot pedals, like KT Tunstall uses for performing “The Black Horse And The Cherry Tree” live. If you’re not familiar with cellos, go and listen to some Rasputina or to “Hounds Of Love”.</p>

<p>There’s a feminist analysis to be had here but I’m not really qualified to make it.</p>

<p>Instead I’m interested in what the equivalent for visual art would be. Charcoal and scanner? Palette knife and digital camera? A dialogue between old high cultural skill and new media reproduction that empowers the individual, making something very new with a lineage. I scanned and arranged paint samples years ago but I was limited by the technology I had available at the time.</p>

<p>One important consideration is that a digital delay doesn’t alter the texture or richness of sound any more than any other performance or recording technology. Scan and print paint or pastel and you lose colour and texture. Reproduction transforms visual media much more markedly. You either have to plan for inkjet, which limits your use of the media, or you have to choose media that will survive scanning. Printmaking and illustration media for example.</p>

<p>Another way of handling this is to use a pen that happens to output mouse movements rather than ink. A Wacom tablet. This can then be worked into vector composition of bitmap pen actions.</p>

<p>The irony of a cybernetically superhuman classicism or folk is reproduced by such a set-up, and if the indexicality of it can be as well then this might be worthwhile.</p>

<p>I wonder what examples there are of this kind of thing?</p>
