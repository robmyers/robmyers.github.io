        Windows 7 Sins
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">27 Aug 2009</span>

    <p>When I first heard about Windows 7 Sins I didn’t like the idea. But then I saw the website, read the arguments, and I found the whole approach very effective.</p>

<p>Take a look here -</p>

<p><a href="http://windows7sins.org/">http://windows7sins.org/</a></p>

<p>I’ve been following people’s reactions to the campaign’s launch on identi.ca. Reaction has mostly been positive, but there have been some criticisms.</p>

<p>I’ve seen comments complaining that it’s a negative campaign. That is, people being negative about it. If it’s OK to criticise things, it’s OK to criticise things, so I find those complaints self-refuting.</p>

<p>And I’ve seen some complaints
about the design. Which means the design is getting people’s attention. The layout and the JavaScript on the page are excellent in my opinion, and the use of colour gets your attention.</p>

<p>To answer another comment, the FSF does positive campaigning that emphasizes the advantages of Free Software <em>every day</em>. Asking for examples of events that are positive ignores the rest of the FSF’s work. But sometimes you need to answer other people’s arguments, and Microsoft are spending an awful lot of time and money arguing that Windows 7 is a good thing at the moment. From the point of view of free software it patently isn’t, and if the FSF remained silent in the face of this then we <em>would</em> have something to complain about.</p>

<p>For me that song is “Ashes To Ashes”, though. ;-)</p>

<p>If art is ideologically normative representation then this US Military simulation of the world is contemporary art of the highest order - <a href="http://therearenosunglasses.wordpress.com/2009/08/22/sentient-world-war-games-on-the-grandest-scale/">http://therearenosunglasses.wordpress.com/2009/08/22/sentient-world-war-games-on-the-grandest-scale/</a></p>

<p>The layered feedback model of perception has long made sense to me from my study of art, and I think that Minsky’s “Society of Mind” is an idea worth revisiting with a statistical rather than rule-based basis.</p>

        Affect Mining
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">24 Aug 2009</span>

    <p>Extracting affect (or sentiment) from electronic text is a hard problem, and it’s difficult to persuade people just how hard it is. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/24/technology/internet/24emotion.html">The Manhattan Times has an article</a> that explains just how difficult it is, and has lots of useful links to projects and resources. The stand-out link is to Lillian Lee’s paper “<a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/llee/opinion-mining-sentiment-analysis-survey.html">Opinion mining and sentiment analysis</a>”.</p>

<p>The first project I became aware of that tackled emotion online was <a href="http://www.wefeelfine.org/">We Feel Fine</a>, which uses blogs as its source. More recent systems tend to use Twitter, such as <a href="http://twittermood.org/">http://twittermood.org/</a> which has useful links to the essays “<a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/757723154j4w726k/">Measuring the Happiness of Large-Scale Written Expression</a>” and “<a href="http://www.webecologyproject.org/2009/08/detecting-sadness-in-140-characters/">Detecting Sadness in 140 Characters</a>” in its references.</p>

<p>And it’s an older book now but Rosalind Picard’s “<a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=4060">Affective Computing</a>” is still a useful resource, particularly for its study of emotional taxonomies.</p>

        Durian - New Blender Movie
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">21 Aug 2009</span>

    <p>The Blender Foundation have previously made two short computer animated films codenamed Orange and Peach to help drive development of their 3D modelling and rendering software. Earlier this year they announced a third codenamed Durian. Very little is known about it at this point but I’ve every confidence it will be as distinctive and as well-made as the first two (which I reviewed for Furtherfield).</p>

<p>Not just the final films but all the modelling and other files used to make the films are included in the DVD and online releases of each project. Everything from the film is licenced under Creative Commons’s Attribution licence, and all the improvements to Blender are under the GPL. It’s a great contribution to free culture and free software, and although some of the costs are covered by sponsorship it’s also partly paid for by pre-sales of the DVDs.</p>

<p>You can see the announcement here -</p>

<p><a href="http://durian.blender.org/news/durian-project-announcement/">http://durian.blender.org/news/durian-project-announcement/</a></p>

<p>The project’s blog is here -</p>

<p><a href="http://durian.blender.org/">http://durian.blender.org/</a></p>

<p>And you can pre-order the DVD(s, there’s 3 of them in the box) here -</p>

<p><a href="http://www.blender3d.org/e-shop/product_info_n.php?products_id=120">http://www.blender3d.org/e-shop/product_info_n.php?products_id=120</a></p>

<p>The DVDs are sent out before the film is released online. Order now and get your name in the credits at the end of the film!</p>
