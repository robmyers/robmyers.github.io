    <p>I am going to be largely offline over christmas and new year. I have a Wiimote to play with from GNU/Linux and will be soldering up a sensor bar for it. I’ve also got some colour sensors when my soldering station arrives. I also have lots of reading to do and some thinking about exactly what to get up to next year.<br />
Have a good Christmas and new year.</p>

    <p>I’m on myspace. If you are astonishingly cool I’ll add you as a friend. Failing that, if you’ve always wondered what I look like I have photos:</p>

    <p>Sun have made Duke “Free graphics”. His graphics are BSD licensed (not BY…), and some are Illustrator postcript files which are a bit difficult to load. So here they are converted to SVG:</p>

<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2006/12/duketar.gz">Duke SVGs</a></p>

<p>One has some bad artefacts on Duke’s-actually what is that? A nose? An eye? Anyway, the red blob isn’t very good on one of the images. If anyone can fix that let me know.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://duke.dev.java.net/">Duke’s homepage</a> for more info, 3D files and more images. No idea how Duke’s freedom interacts with his trademark status. Someone should definitely produce some Duke pr0n to see how this works. ;-)</p>

        Promises To Keep

    <span class="post-date">13 Dec 2006</span>

    <p>I read “Promises To Keep”.</p>

<p>It’s a fact-tastic read, crammed with data and diagrams, and a very well argued thesis, with the two places where the argument doesn’t follow from the examples sticking out like sore thumbs (these are minor parts of the argument, I mention this simply to emphasize how coherent the rest of the book is).</p>

<p>I still have a problem with ACSes, although that is one less problem than I had before reading the book. The balance of privacy and accuracy that the system must strike seems much more plausible from Fisher’s description, but someone like me who listens to old Art &amp; Language songs, fantastically obscure electronica and people with cellos and digital delays won’t be reflected by any system that tries to be representative by sampling rather than by monitoring the entire network.</p>

<p>The problem is that an ACS is still phrased in terms of “incentivisation” and of replacing lost revenue. Comparisons to a “pizza right” aside, I think this argument needs recasting positively and progressively rather than in its current  reformist mode. Present it to the record companies as compensation by all means, but let’s see if it can work and take it forward as the first genuinely democratic form of patronage.</p>
