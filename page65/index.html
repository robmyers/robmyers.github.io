        Mono And Patents

    <p>Mono is a bad idea even without patents. If you want a restrictive statically-typed bytecoded language from a corporation that’s a sworn enemy of Free Software, at least Oracle’s Java is under the GPL.</p>

<p>The FSF explain why even Microsoft’s latest charm offensive doesn’t make Mono any less dangerous -</p>

<p><a href="http://www.informationweek.com/news/software/linux/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=218500894">http://www.fsf.org/news/2009-07-mscp-mono/</a></p>

<p>And Microsoft have kindly provided a timely reminder -</p>

<p><a href="http://www.informationweek.com/news/software/linux/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=218500894">http://www.informationweek.com/news/software/linux/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=218500894</a></p>

<p>Splitting Mono into two projects won’t help. Microsoft’s community promise (sic) covers only perfect implementations of current specifications of the core of what Mono implements. Implement that incorrectly, or implement anything else correctly, and you’re not covered. Splitting Mono just creates two patent threats rather than one. Don’t use Mono.</p>

    <p>Wikimedia Foundation’s statement, correcting a few details that The Guardian and The Register have got wrong -</p>

<p>Dave Gerard’s comments, useful for economic context -</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.wikimedia.org/2009/07/16/protecting-the-public-domain-and-sharing-our-cultural-heritage/">http://davidgerard.co.uk/notes/2009/07/16/wikimedia-writes-on-the-npg-legal-threat/</a></p>

<p>The BBC, quoting Gerard -</p>

<p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8156268.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8156268.stm</a></p>

<p>To re-iterate a point I’ve made in the comments on this blog, the NPG is wrong both ethically and economically. They are a state-funded institution that exists to enable the public to access portraits of notable individuals, and that mission would be better served by collaborating with free culture institutions than by trying to <em>prevent</em> the public accessing portraits of notable individuals in order to monetize bogus rights.</p>

<p>That the NPG have spent a million pounds that they will have to make back by employing a bureaucracy whose expense is barely covered by the licencing fees that “investment” generates is not an argument against the fact that they are wrong to be claiming to enclose the public domain.</p>

<p>If I have put a lock on your house and I’m demanding money before I let you in, the amount of effort I’ve spent on fitting the lock isn’t the most salient point in the discussion…</p>

<p>[UPDATE] - <a href="http://theartlawblog.blogspot.com/2009/07/bridgeman-two.html">http://theartlawblog.blogspot.com/2009/07/bridgeman-two.html</a></p>

<p>British commentators shouldn’t be dismissive of Bridgeman vs. Corel, which was decided with explicit reference to English law.</p>

<p>[UPDATE 2, 20.25/2009-7-19] - <a href="http://davidgerard.co.uk/notes/2009/07/17/npg-talks-are-in-progress-what-would-you-like-to-see-from-them">http://davidgerard.co.uk/notes/2009/07/17/npg-talks-are-in-progress-what-would-you-like-to-see-from-them</a></p>

<p>I’d like to see the NPG admit they cannot hold copyright on the images, and WMF not help the NPG in any rightswashing. WMF can reduce the costs of producing and distributing images and metadata for the NPG and help increase the value of access to the NPG itself. It’s in <em>both</em> institutions interests to do so.</p>

    <p><a href="http://davidgerard.co.uk/notes/2009/07/11/sue-and-be-damned/">http://davidgerard.co.uk/notes/2009/07/11/sue-and-be-damned/</a></p>

<blockquote>_For several years, the National Portrait Gallery has claimed
copyright over public domain images in their possession. Wikimedia has
ignored these claims, occasionally laughing. ([Bridgeman v. Corel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgeman_Art_Library_v._Corel_Corp.). Sweat of the brow is not creation in US law; go away.) Our official stance in this time has been "sue and be damned."_
&gt; 
&gt; _So the National Portrait Gallery has tried. [Here's their letter](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Dcoetzee/NPG_legal_threat).
A lollipop for every misconception or unlikely or impossible demand.
This was sent after (so they claim) the WMF ignored their latest
missive. The editor they sent the threat to is ... [an American](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Dcoetzee)._
&gt; 
&gt; _A UK organisation is threatening an American with legal action over
uploading images that are public domain in the US to an American server
-- unambiguously, in established US law, not a copyright violation of
any sort. I wonder how the case will go._
&gt; 
&gt; </blockquote>

<p>The standard of originality in the UK needs raising, but the extent of copyright that English galleries and other institutions claim over public domain works exceeds even that. It is harmful to academia and art, and it is morally wrong. We have long needed a Bridgeman vs. Corel in the UK, and hopefully this could be it. The Wikimedia Foundation is popular, organized, and solvent enough to be able to tackle the state and private interests that claim to sit between the public and the public domain.</p>

<blockquote></blockquote>

<p>The Wikimedia Foundation shouldn’t be fobbed off with an offer of a grant or licence of rights, as there should be no rights to grant or licence. If the Foundation fail and this enclosure of the public domain is formalized in English law it will still have been worth trying, and converting overreach into a legal principle at least opens it to reform.</p>

<p>Good luck to the WMF, and a hint to the NPG - you are a national, state institution that exists to serve the public. You are not serving it by claiming to enclose the public domain.</p>
