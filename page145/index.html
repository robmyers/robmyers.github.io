    <p>Viewer A looks at artworks as more or less competent illustrations of theory. They are expert in the latest translated French theory and understand the semiotic and technical content of the work. The economics and social relations of an artworks production are admissable only inasmuchas they excuse theoretical failings.</p>

<p>Viewer B looks at artworks as more or less valuable assets. They are expert in the work’s provenance and the artist’s personal history and social standing. The theoretical and aesthetic content of an artwork is admissable only inasmuchas they excuse any aesthetic interiority on the part of the artwork.</p>

    <p>An artist should only receive public money when the value of the art that they make using that money is made available to the public.It should be a condition of receiving Arts Council funding that any work produced is made available to the public under a Creative Commons Attribution or Share-Alike licence (not Non-Commercial or No-Derivatives licenses as these deny value to the public).This ensures that the public are able to benefit from the work they have paid for by copying from it while the artist is still free to sell the original work.</p>

        Life Drawing
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">05 May 2007</span>

    <p>Wednesday night was the second life drawing session I’ve been to at The Glass Onion. I got two drawings done, and during the second drawing something just clicked and I remembered how to draw from life. Last time I was struggling to get everything in proportion and ended up with some drawings with accurate individual sections that did not come together to form a whole that could be appreciated by anyone other than Victor Frankenstein on a bad day.A book I hadn’t read when I first did life drawing (getting on for 20 years ago now) but would recommend highly to anyone who’s convinced they will never be able to draw is “Drawing On The Right Side Of The Brain”. See if your local library has a copy.”Drawing On The Right Side Of The Brain” is concerned, amongst other things, with the skills of sighting ratios and angles. The skills of sighting ratios and angles are Renaissance mercantile and civil engineering skills. They have a class/social origin, a historical origin. Does this make practicing life drawing in the age of relational aesthetics socially irrelevent, mere historical nostalgia, civil war re-enactment for aesthetes? I don’t think that it does.Charcoal remains in use for drawing despite the many more modern alternatives that are available because it has a useful quality that is very hard to surpass.Â  Photography or actually arranging people in a gallery do not have the same quality as life drawing. It is a different investigation, a different way of relating to the subject. Life drawing is a record of protracted consideration and representation of understanding of the human form that you can’t get any other way.</p>
