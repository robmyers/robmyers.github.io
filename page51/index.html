        The Supernaturalism of Qualia
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">23 May 2010</span>

    <p>Qualia are experiential properties that you cannot reduce further or explain in terms of anything else. The colour red for example. Red cannot be broken down to sklee, flurb and mwow. Nor can it be explained in terms of wum or arnun. Because of this we cannot know whether anyone else experiences the colour red the same as we do. The stability of relationships between colours isn’t a problem for the idea of qualia as something un-communicable. If what you experience as green I experience as orange, we still experience the same colour relationships and apply the name ‘blue’ to their subject when discussing them publicly.</p>

<p>Qualia may simply be like Lisp ‘symbols’, names at some effectively random point in memory used to refer stably to a concept. There is nothing supernatural here, but there is a limit on what we can usefully or interestingly describe. I don’t find qualia a barrier to either naturalism or AI. That people experience things differently doesn’t invalidate experience or unreal it. If we all experienced the same individuality that would be a problem…</p>

        Using a 3 Wireless Broadband USB Stick Under Fedora
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">23 May 2010</span>

    <p>I bought a 3 Wireless Broadband USB Stick to use with my Fedora subnotebook.</p>

<p>Installing it was about as painful as installing a WiFi adapter a few years ago.</p>

<p>Install modeswitch to switch the usb stick to broadband mode (I think) -</p>

<p>su -c ‘yum install usb_modeswitch usb_modeswitch-data’</p>

<p>Reboot (I think).</p>

<p>Plug in the wireless broadband stick.</p>

<p>Configure the wireless broadband connection using Network Manager or System/Preferences/Network Connections</p>

<p>Select ‘enable wireless broadband’ from the network manager right-click menu.</p>

<p>Connect to 3’s web site to register and get sent your password by SMS.</p>

<p>Install gammu to get the text message containing the password -</p>

<p>su -c ‘yum install gammu’</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>dmesg</td>
      <td>grep tty</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>gammu-config</p>

<p>su -c ‘chmod +rw /dev/ttyUSB2’</p>

<p>gammu getallsms</p>

<p>Use the password to complete online registration and you’re ready to go.</p>

        Ebooks
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">02 May 2010</span>

    <p>I love books. At art school we learnt how to print and bind them, but I was reading them long before that and I’m one of those people for whom death by bookpile is not an unrealistic threat. So it’s the physicality of books as artefacts as well as the knowledge and fantasy they contain that has always appealed to me.</p>

<p>I also love computing machinery and high technology. Combine this with books and you get ebooks. “Ebooks” is a misonmer. You don’t call an <a href="http://www.xiph.org/downloads/">ogg vorbis</a> file an e-vinyl, or an ogg theora track an e-VHS. They should be etexts. But the ebook name has stuck. An ebook reader is a physical device used to read ebooks. I was using an old Palm Pilot, then my Android phone. I’ve now bought a <a href="http://openinkpot.org/">BeBook One</a> and installed the free OpenInkpot on it to get a free software ebook reader system.</p>

<p>The BeBook uses an e-paper display, which means the display flashes black before each page refresh (you get used to it, which surprised me) and the image remains even if the system isn’t drawing any power. I won’t pretend that the resources used to manufacture and deliver the BeBook are less than those consumed in the production of many dozen paper-and-ink books, but it is energy efficient. Ebook readers might appear to be a temporary aberration, dedicated devices that will soon be superseded by general-purpose devices such as the iPad. But I like to concentrate when reading, and that means that the absence of a Twitter client is a plus not a minus for a dedicated ebook reader.</p>

<p>Like the music industry’s ten year sulk over Napster, the publishing industry and far too many authors who should otherwise know better regard the vastly increased audience and demand for books in electronic format as a threat rather than an opportunity. Many books that I would purchase as ebooks have two problems. Firstly, they have idiotic <a href="http://www.defectivebydesign.org/">DRM</a> on them that prevent me buying and using them on the hardware and software that I use. Secondly, they have ridiculous prices that are equal to or greater than the hardback price for the same book despite the greatly reduced production costs of the ebook.</p>

<p>There are two ways of looking at the freedom to read an ebook.</p>

<p>Free Software requires that you be able to use the software that displays the book as you see fit and that the book not require any limitations or controls in the software that reads it. DRM and proprietary ebook reader software breaks this. Free reader software like OpenInkpot and <a href="http://www.fbreader.org/">FBReader</a>, and free and open formats like epub without DRM added support this.</p>

<p>Free Culture requires that you be free to use the book, at the very least to have your fair use/fair dealing rights, and preferably to have the freedom to use it without restriction. Ideally the book will have a copyleft licence such as Creative Commons BY-SA, but it must at least not have DRM applied.</p>

<p>I prefer books that are both free software and free culture, but it’s difficult to avoid non-free culture of value.</p>

<p>Out of copyright works are ideal. The best source of these is Project Gutenberg, which now provides epub version -</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Main_Page">www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Main_Page</a></p>

<p>The website Manybooks formats up Gutenberg texts in many different formats and aggregates other texts as well. It’s a good way of finding contemporary books available under Creative Commons licences -</p>

<p><a href="http://manybooks.net/categories/CCL">manybooks.net/categories/CCL</a></p>

<p>Google Books has many out of copyright books and magazines that Gutenberg doesn’t.. These are available from archive.org, which has many other out of copyright and Creative Commons licenced books as well -</p>

<p><a href="http://www.archive.org/search.php?query=mediatype:texts">www.archive.org/search.php?query=mediatype:texts</a></p>

<p>Smashwords ebooks are not Creative Commons licenced but are DRM-free and reasonably priced -</p>

<p><a href="http://www.smashwords.com/">www.smashwords.com/</a></p>

<p>FLOSS Manuals are producing collaboratively edited manuals for free software -</p>

<p><a href="http://en.flossmanuals.net/">en.flossmanuals.net/</a></p>

<p>And Artists Ebooks are exploring the possibilities of ebooks by artists -</p>

<p><a href="http://www.artistsebooks.org/">www.artistsebooks.org/</a></p>

<p>I’ll post some specific ebooks to try in another post, but the above are where most of the ones I’ve read have come from.</p>

        Cultures Of Scale
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">12 Apr 2010</span>

    <p>I call it “the cultural smog of the Internet”. If you want just about any novel or album or film ever produced you can find it in a matter of seconds or hours. The focus of high culture that restricted culture to a canon, and the amnesia of mass culture that replaced bands and TV shows every couple of years, has given way to a flat or post-historical cultural simultaneity even as time has started to flow again after the brief post-cold-war fantasy of “the end of history”.</p>

<p>Ease of consumption has been accompanied by a dropping of the barriers to production to an almost negligible level in western culture. Anyone can play guitar, but absolutely everyone can play a sample of someone else playing guitar in a mash-up or comment on it in a blog. This is that democracy you were always talking about, the world of everyone being an artist. Be careful what you wish for.</p>

<p>In the past, the cultural canon was more than most people could hope to read or hear (or see) in their lifetime. Now it’s much, much less. Culture approaches The Condition Of Muzak, of the unceasing BGM (background music) of anime. If we can choose an almost random subset of an almost infinite set of cultural works as our personal canon, how can we speak to others? How can we avoid private-language-like private culture? How can we cheat solipsism?</p>

<p>“This week is Killers week” said one of the kids sitting a few seats away from me on the railway station a few years ago. Popular culture, mass culture, was always supply-side and not only required but produced a kind of cultural amnesia and lack of purchase. That’s why the fifties are back once a decade, even if we call them the sixties because that’s when they were truly commodified.</p>

<p>When the culture one may encounter is effectively random, the human may be emphasized rather than undermined. One’s taste, one’s ability not to react but to engage and conceptualise, becomes key and becomes strengthened. When culture is contingent people are not.</p>

<p>Cultures of scale are the harmonic, set-based, expertise-based-on-exposure-to-many-works-rather-than-a-few, emergent taste and aesthetic products of individual human subjects that only breathing the cultural smog of the internet can produce. We haven’t even begun to guess at them. But rather than retreating into the reactionary defeatism of artificial canons or into the managerialism-that-protests-too-much of semiotic analysis or into the complicit mass-media surfing of cool hunting we should meet cultures of scale and their subjects head on as aesthetics, as valid territory for the history and theory and philosophy of art.</p>
