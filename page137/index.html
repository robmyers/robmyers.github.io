        What Is Index 01 Like?
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">08 Jun 2007</span>

    <p>Index 01 (1972) by Art &amp; Language consists of a set of filing cabinets filled with texts written by the extended Art &amp; Language collective of the time, with printed indexes of the texts indicating their compatibility with each other in the collective’s discourse placed on the wall. It is a piece of art that is open to a possible audience of readers. It seems unprecedented and isolated in the history of art, belonging more to the office furniture of bureaucratic management or of libraries than to painting or sculpture.</p>

<p>Index 01 is radical, but it doesn’t exist in a complete vacuum. There are three examples I would contrast with Index 01, the latter two of which are contemporary with it.</p>

<p>Marcel Duchamp’s “The Bride Stripped Bare By Her Batchelors, Even (The Large Glass)” predates Index 01 by some sixty years. It is a free-standing painting in metal and oil paint on glass, about as painterly as a set of filing cabinets. The forms in it were determined by Duchamp’s writings and were produced in a series of studies before being assembled in The Large Glass. Like Index 01 is a combination of forms determined by writing. It is a form of index, an assemblage of forms whose relations embody conceptual concerns. The Large Glass is the embodiment of its index rather than the indexical relations of the work being explained by texts placed on the wall, and the texts are elsewhere.</p>

<p>Sol LeWitt’s drawings have a similar concern with platonic form, although they are more immediately aesthetic than Index 01. LeWitt’s drawings constructed from verbal descriptions, whether colours or coloured shapes or geometric shapes constructed according to constraints, are conceptually determined forms. They are more aesthetic than Index 01, but they do construct form conceptually. Like Index 01 and The Large Glass the text precedes and creates the form of “the work”. The platonism of this is critical, it is a line of resistance.</p>

<p>Gilbert and George’s work as living sculptures is arch- (and arch) romanticism rather than analytical philosophy and politics or sociology, but it has commonalities with Index 01. Gilbert and George substituted social form for sculptural form, declaring themselves sculpture. Body rather than text, and romantic conservatism rather than materialist radicalism, but non-aesthetic form expressed socially. The “singing sculptures” are the negative of Index 01, the defensible and resistant production of form in an ironically conservative mode.</p>

<p>I don’t expect that Art &amp; Language would find these comparisons flattering or interesting. But I believe that they provide at least an interesting contrast, and that they may be instructive.</p>

    <p><strong>The Bleeding Obvious</strong></p>

<p>“For The Love Of God” by Damien Hirst is not art, it’s ethically dubious for various reasons, its costing is suspect, the big jewel on the forehead spoils any claim it might have to aesthetic interest, and it’s basically a simple reversal of the usual formula of blinged up teeth in a living skull.</p>

<p><strong>Ceci n’est pas l’art</strong></p>

<p>More interesting is why it isn’t art. An overheated art market assigns and justifies the price of a piece of art as the measure of its worth. It doesn’t matter how materially impoverished the art is, it can be some rags with oily earth scraped on stretched over some pieces of wood and still be worth tens of millions of dollars. This is the point of the market for those who buy. They are doing with art what they did with hedge funds. This is ritual, the economic becoming the symbolic, aesthetic mythology being made into economic icons. This is the assertion of a new class’s self-image and a rearguard action against any newer money. That is what high art usually is.</p>

<p>“For The Love Of God” has catastrophically misunderstood this. It seeks to justify the economics of the market economically. It is an object that has been ridiculously expensive to manufacture and is therefore worthy of a ridiculous price. This doesn’t give the market anything to do. If Hirst wanted to give the market something to really get its wallet out for he should charge 100 million dollars for one of his concepts, or for each of an edition of 100 skulls, or for a genuinely awful painting (his assistants can crank those out by the dozen). That would take some serious dollar transubstantiation.</p>

<p>The argument that Hirst and his business manager are just taking the market for a ride, Jasper-Johns-two-beer-cans-style, doesn’t work. And Hirst’s move here isn’t a Stella-like aesthetic observation of the letter of the law rather than the spirit. It is an erroneous error theory of the market value of art made into an artwork.</p>

<p><strong>Dust Brothers</strong></p>

<p>A limited edition is available of silkscreen prints of a photograph of the skull complete with diamond dust applied to the glaze. Those American commentators who dismiss Hirst as a Koons copyist don’t have an interesting point, but this is pure Warhol. Warhol produced silkscreens of a skull and of himself with a skull. The images over which he sprinkled diamond dust weren’t his best work, the cash value added by diamond dust is an implicit admission of the lack of aesthetic value.</p>

<p><strong>With Dead Head</strong></p>

<p>This is Hirst’s contemporary self-portrait. He is no longer gurning fearfully next to a decapitated head, he has taken its skull and made it a model of his own. There is no contrast between this empty sparkle and his own flesh and bone. The spark has gone, his head has been emptied of what art it contained and replaced with economics.</p>

<p>There is no aesthetic or emotional value in a multi-million dollar memento mori, it is a self-defeating object. All that remains under the bling is the crooked yellow smile. This used to be Damien Hirst. There is the ghost of a tragedy here, but the materialism of economics leaves no place for ghosts.</p>

    <p>“No Secret Painting V”, 2006, is a work by Art &amp; Language (A&amp;L;) consisting of a large square dark abstract canvas accompanied by a smaller framed text that seems to refer to it.</p>

<p>The accompaniment of a dark abstract square by a text is a scheme that Art &amp; Language used in their “Secret Paintings” and “Guaranteed Paintings” of the 1960s. These referred to Malevich and to Stella, and to certificates of authenticity for conceptual artworks. But unlike the secret paintings the composition of the squares (and lines) within the canvas are perceptible.</p>

<p>The plaid pattern is from A&amp;L;’s earlier piece “Wrongs Healed In Official Hope”, an installation of canvases and of filing cabinets made from canvases as a parody or travesty of A&amp;L;’s earlier text-based Indices of the 1970s. The text it contained was not a piece of art criticism, politics, or set theory, but an extreme pornographic sado-masochistic fantasy set at a girl’s boarding school rendered increasingly abstract by textual transformation and substitution.</p>

<p>Eventually the text in “Wrongs Healed In Official Hope” became an abstract pattern of squares and lines, a decorative plaid pattern. This decorativeness appears to have no content, only decorative effect, but it is haunted by typographic grids and these lead back to a textual expression of degenerate taste. The implication seemed to be that the plaid was no less a product of that taste. There are no comfortable chairs in the work of A&amp;L.;</p>

<p>Accompanying texts that seem to describe or specify some aspect of the image that they are counterposed with were also a feature of A&amp;L;’s “Flags For Organizations” and “Gustave Courbet’s Burial At Ornans Expressing…”. It is this last piece that the text in “No Secret Painting” seems to serve a similar function to. It specifies or describes the four sections of the canvas as having certain content. But unlike “Burial At Ornans…” there is an aesthetic and genetic connection between the text and the image. Some of the text of “Wrongs Healed In Official Hope” is incorporated, and the composition of the plaid is mentioned.</p>

<p>In both the visibility of the painting’s pictorial content and in the fact that the text does actually shed some light on that content this is not a secret painting. A secret is neither set up nor revealed. Where the secret paintings pointed an accusing finger, deflating the mysteries of other works and of the viewer’s regard, “No Secret Painting” is self-deflating.</p>

<p>But this is not A&amp;L; For Dummies. The painting and the text both refer not just to each other but to “Wrongs Healed…”, and to more than “Wrongs Healed”. This is an index, and the viewer has work to do. As with the apparently blank surfaces of “Index: Now They Are”, these are allegories of an artistic paradigm. I just haven’t quite worked out exactly which one just yet…</p>
