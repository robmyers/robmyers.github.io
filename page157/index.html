        NC Is Not Magnatune's Secret Sauce
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">17 Nov 2006</span>

    <p>The NC business model that Magnatune use has clearly inspired Creative Commons. Magnatune’s success makes them a very positive model for a record label, but not in the way that might be expected from their use of NC. The problem is that the threats to their livelihoods that recording artists actually face are not the same as the ones that NC actually tackles.</p>

<p><strong>NC doesn’t protect artists from losing value from non-sales distribution.</strong></p>

<p>NC explicitly allows both internet-era filesharing and walkman-era personal copying. NC therefore gives away any value that a direct audience for music can actually want to take. And it is as powerless as standard copyright to stop organized illegal commercial copying.</p>

<p><strong>NC doesn’t protect artists from being ripped off by middlemen.</strong></p>

<p>Artists who use NC can still sign to a record label. Which NC then cannot prevent ripping them off, failing to promote them, or dropping them. Magnatune clearly state that they are not evil and make clear and public the financial terms of their relationship with their signed artists. This is far more important than NC for artists not being ripped off.<br />
**<br />
NC is not the dissuader in NC-SA, SA is.**</p>

<p>Magnatune will sell proprietary licences for music by their artists to film producers who wish to use the music commercially. But it is unlikely that those producers would SA their films if the music they wish to use was SA-only. NC on top of SA is simply redundant in this case.</p>

<p>**NC is not Magnatune’s secret sauce. **</p>

<p>NC doesn’t stop artists losing sales, being ripped off, or losing proprietary use revenue. The secret sauce in Magnatune’s business model is their strong and public ethical position, and this is far more difficult to reproduce technologically than their use of NC.</p>

        Last Night's Talk By Harold Cohen
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">15 Nov 2006</span>

    <p>Harold gave an excellent presentation of how and why AARON’s new colouring system works. I’ve just about hacked up an implementation of the system for draw-something from my notes in a couple of hours, so you can tell that Harold is a thorough speaker as well as an insightful and sometimes humorous one. ;-)</p>

<p>AARON’s new colour system uses three lists of numbers, one for hue created from an additive series with a random start, one for saturation generated randomly and sorted into low/medium/high ranges, and another for value created the same way. AARON then chooses the hue according to the kind of object, and the saturation and value from the low/medium/high ranges according to the probabilities assigned to them. There’s some error correction and some mach-band-like generation of slightly lighter and darker colours for edge adornment but as Harold said it is a very much simpler system than AARON was using before.</p>

<p>It is also a strikingly successful system aesthetically. The colours and the contrast of the images are pleasing and interesting, sometimes mellow, sometimes dramatic, always “creative”. Perhaps this has to do with the new system matching our cognitive perceptual system’s preferences in some way.</p>

<p>I asked a question, badly, and got an answer with some interesting details about how AARON handles intersecting objects. A Furtherfield reviewer was there so hopefully a review will be up on Furtherfield soon. Many thanks to the excellent Computer Arts Society and Imperial College for arranging the talk.</p>

<p><em>It has been suggested that there would be some value in CC entering the field of software licensing. I am skeptical (there are plenty of software licenses) but the explosion of mixed code/content platforms (e.g., Flash) has led me to at least get feedback about the idea. So if you have thoughts about this, I’d be grateful if you could send them to software-licensing@creativecommons.org</em></p>

<p>Please email CC to oppose this. It’s an interesting area but YAL is not the solution.</p>

<p>Possibly CC could draft a GPL-3 exception to allow aggregation with BY-SA content?</p>

<p><em>Bounty Hunters is a clever exercise in explaining the copyfight. I suspect it will resonate strongly with some readers who haven’t encountered or understood the subject.</em></p>

<p>I bought a print copy a while back and I highly recommend it.</p>
