    <p>I got a wireless card for my iBook. It’s easy enough to fit, but routing the net connection through the machine that is connected to the net took some fiddling with the firewall, and too many passwords. This isn’t the card’s fault, it’s MacOSX’s connection sharing software, but the combination could be easier to set up.</p>

<p>I’m posting this now using the connection, so it can be made to work. But it’s not the simple user experience I expect from Apple.</p>

        Bloc Party: Silent Alarm
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">22 Feb 2005</span>

    <p>Songs to listen to after the end of a ten-year relationship should probably go something like:</p>

<p>“It’s so cold in this house… Like drinking poison, like eating glass.”</p>

<p>So ‘Silent Alarm’ by Bloc Party is ideal for me just now. There’s a good measure of dark and acutely observed songs on the album. But there’s beauty as well, as in the current single “So Here We Are”. It’s a good range, musically as well as emotionally. I’ve no idea who Gang Of Four are, so Bloc Party sound like the Cure, The Police, New Order, and other late 1970s/ early 1980s influences that I can’t quite place. Which isn’t to say that this is pastiche, it isn’t, it’s poetic lyrics and driven music that works very well and sounds fresh and young. In some places it sounds a little too young, as if Bloc Party haven’t been to Hamburg yet, but that just means that they have more potential for the future.</p>

<p>Recommended.</p>

    <p>So it’s coming up to 10am and the removal men have almost packed everything that’s going. Evie’s over at her new house with the Nag Champa that I bought her. Helping her move out has been like digging my own grave, only without the promise of any respite at the end. But at least I have been as good as my word. I don’t really have anything else I can be.</p>

    <p>I like MANIK’s art. Their current HTML text work, like Chris Ashley’s HTML table work, makes an engaging high art in a medium that you wouldn’t expect to have the aesthetic bandwidth.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.o-o.lt/asco-o/">ASCO-O </a></p>

<p>MANIK’s work constantly makes me revisit my assumptions about the form of art, whilst animating my belief in the continuing possibilities of its content. I hope they get an archive of their email pieces from the Rhizome list together, those are the perfect complement to this. The Rhizome pieces are more like this one:</p>
