    <p>The review of Ranciere’s and Badiou’s respective aesthetics in Radical Philosophy 131 complains that neither tackle capitalism head-on.</p>

<p>This is both vital (ignoring capitalism renders aesthetics irrelevant or distractive) and pointless (capitalism is atmospheric, and already distorts and redirects everything else).</p>

<p>Possibly this should be double-whammied; render capitalism aesthetic, and aesthetics capitalistic. This would be neither Naomi Klein nor Walter Benjamin, rather an analysis of the projective geometry of exchange value.</p>

    <p>paintr is draw-something’s evil twin. It’s the post-dot-com approach as opposed to draw-something’s pre-ai-winter approach.</p>

<p>It would be interesting to transcend the two approaches, but it’s easier for now to combine them, getting draw-something to draw the shapes and manage the colours. Whether that would be interesting enough I don’t know. Maybe I could prototype something quickly.</p>

    <p>colr.org going down has forced a switch to colourlovers.com, which in turn has caused me to reconsider paintr.</p>

<p>I want to use folksonomies as the externalised knowledgebase and opinionbase of online humanity, the ironised triumph of classical artificial intelligence. Each folksonomy must be exemplary in its class.</p>

<p>These folksonomies are to be used by a process that makes something “almost, but not entirely, quite unlike” art. A parodically simple ‘social history of art’ view of the production of art would be that an artist identifies some social need and produces an aesthetic account of or resolution for this.</p>

<p>So paintr should:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Go to technorati, find some of the most popular tags.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Find an image at flickr with these tags.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Find a palette and apply this.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>A more Adorno-influenced paintr would use wordnet to find the opposites of the tags in order to provide a critique, or possibly invert the palette.</p>

    <p>I wanted to remix images again, and I found an image at Remix Reading that appealed to me. It was a posterised photograph of a street in Reading by Tom Chance, and it had lots of shapes (probably tracing artefacts) that I liked quite independently of any descriptive function they had. I autotraced the image and took the shapes I wanted, arranging them into new compositions, subconsciously influenced by the Matisse prints at my local McDonalds and some ceramic drinks coasters that my mother made.</p>

<p>Mackenzie Wark regards hacking as releasing pure virtuality, which I take to mean latent or unrealised potential. Paul Miller regards remixing as an interrogation of meaning. The two are at odds, as remixing is hacking, but they are complementary, as meaning is not finite. Even a single image has so much potential.</p>

<p>I made the first image Evie was away, then when she came back and told me she was going away for good I dedicated it to her. It seemed fitting. These goth-Matisse pieces are the anti-Blim, at the other end of ten years of my life. The title is a reference to a comment on ‘The Creative Remix’ about remixes of classical poems, but also refers to a section of a hymn or poem. Again it seemed fitting.</p>
