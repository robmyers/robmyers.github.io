    <p>Most AI art producers begin from a model of child art. <br />
Children’s art is knowledge-based, figure based, and emergent (unplanned). <br />
In contrast, an “adult” (professional) figurative artist is observation-based, balances positive and negative space, and works on the composition before the content of the work.<br />
A program that worked in this way would pre-scan the picture plane and tag its elements (pixels or pre-generated polygons) with relational information:<br />
• close to the edge, centre, top, bottom, left, right<br />
• on the edge of the picture plane<br />
• proximity to other elements<br />
• relative size<br />
• formal qualities (jagged, smooth, triangular, square)<br />
The next stage of the program can then work with a richer environment.<br />
Embody compositional principles: golden sections, horizontal/vertical/diagonal, ground/sky line, etc.<br />
Valence the plane, valence the compositional principles, then build the composition. <br />
Give equal weight to figure and ground, to positive and negative space.<br />
This is a technical exercise, but figure/ground relations are important in art. The boundary or distribution of shapes must be aesthetically interesting in some extra-aesthetic way. This sounds like “No Logo” or philosophy/business theory.</p>

    <p>The beholder gazes at the artwork, disinterested, finding immanent and unmediated emotional experience contained within it.<br />
The consumer views the artwork, their discourse unreflectingly illustrated by it.<br />
The participant renders the artwork, engaging with it to generate the experience of it. Canvases are scene-graph scripts or interactors.</p>

    <p>Richter’s blurry photo paintings as critique. <br />
JPEGs are a ‘green’ format, conserving limited resources (in bad conscience). They prioritise distribution over fidelity. Their participant’s gaze ignores loss. reconstituting it from expectation, glad to receive an approximation in less time.</p>

<p>‘JPEG is designed for compressing either full-color or gray-scale images<br />
of natural, real-world scenes. It works well on photographs, naturalistic<br />
artwork, and similar material; not so well on lettering, simple cartoons,<br />
or line drawings. JPEG handles only still images, but there is a related<br />
standard called MPEG for motion pictures.<br />
JPEG is “lossy,” meaning that the decompressed image isn’t quite the same as<br />
the one you started with. (There are lossless image compression algorithms,<br />
but JPEG achieves much greater compression than is possible with lossless<br />
methods.) JPEG is designed to exploit known limitations of the human eye,<br />
notably the fact that small color changes are perceived less accurately than<br />
small changes in brightness. Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images<br />
that will be looked at by humans. If you plan to machine-analyze your<br />
images, the small errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even<br />
if they are invisible to the eye.’ - <em>http://www.faqs.org/faqs/jpeg-faq/part1/</em></p>

    <p>Practice masking acrylic with advesive vinyl. <br />
Is it possible to photosensitise oil paint, or to dry oil by exposing it to UV through a negative and then wash off any unexposed areas with solvent?</p>
