        Grammatical Fallacies Exposed
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">19 Jan 2008</span>

    <p>I had the misfortune to find a book called “Economic fallacies Exposed” in Oxfam today. It’s a collection of Market-Hegelian screeds that perform the same cheap trick each time for a presumably captive audience:Firstly an ethical, cultural, environmental (etc.) statement is translated into a fallacious economic statement.Secondly, that fallacious economic statement is shown to be fallacious.Thirdly, this demonstration of fallaciousness is used to dismiss the original statement.The results are stunning. Ethical, cultural, environmental (etc.) statements are shown to be utterly false by a kind of null-underwritten truthiness that would find utter bogosity an unreachable aspiration.To demonstrate the problem with this strategy, here is an excerpt from the book “Grammatical Fallacies Exposed”:<strong>The Free Market Is Benefit At Society.</strong>This is nonsense. Free Markets are therefore evil.<strong>Government Are Baddest To Regulating Corporate Activity, What Harms.</strong>This is double nonsense. Unregulated corporate activity must therefore be prevented by government intervention.<strong>Economists Are Having Understanding Of Economicalityness.</strong>This isn’t even trying to look grammatical. Economists are therefore ignorant dolts.</p>

    <p>Would personal copying of media you own, copying work for study, library copying, or legal protection for parody and pastiche help you? Or do you know of any examples of social or economic “harm” that such rights would prevent? If so please comment on ORG’s reprint of this givernment review:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.openrightsgroup.org/consult/taking-forward-gowers-copyright-exceptions/#respond">consultation test » Blog Archive » Taking forward Gowers: Copyright Exceptions</a></p>

<blockquote>_This consultation is intended to bring greater flexibility to the UK copyright regime by strengthening existing and introducing some entirely new exceptions.  
  
The point of copyright law is to engineer a market in creative expressions and in doing so the law tries to balance the competing interests of creators, publishers and the general public. In this mechanism, exceptions to monopoly rights protect a range of socially-important activities, such as education or reportage. They operate as a kind of safety valve.  
  
We have not reproduced the entire consultation document because its 106 pages long. Instead, extracted below is the more-manageable Executive Summary, which outlines the consultation's concerns. The Open Rights Group submission will concentrate on the ‘format shifting' and ‘parody' exceptions but you're invited to leave comments on any aspect of the consultation. _</blockquote>
