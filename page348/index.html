<p>An Open Content Art host. This is great. But it explicitly requires that all work be Noncommercial, rather than allowing a choice of license. Noncommercial is less Free than allowing commercial use, and grows less value (less art in this case). Hopefully they’ll allow people to choose their own license soon. <br />
Ideally there’ll be a “ContentForge” for Free Culture projects soon like the Sourceforge site for software projects today.</p>

    <p>The problem with Open Content is that it is concerned with end products, not source material, and is aimed at consumers, not producers. This reduces its value to both. <br />
Free Software (Open Source), the inspiration for Open Content, ensures the free availability and free circulation of source code and supporting files. These are the materials that are used to make the program. If you want to change, extend, build on or borrow part of the source code existing program you can because it is the responsibility of everyone who works with the source code to make it publicly available.<br />
Open Content only requires that the end product be made available. You can sample Open Content, remix it or compile it, but you don’t have access to the source materials used to make it as a guarantee of the license. If Open Content were software, the binaries (the runnable application) would be free, but the source code wouldn’t be released. <br />
Open Content licenses must contain a guarantee to make source material available. The Midi files, the samples, the LaTeX or Docbook sources, the 3D models, the textures, the shaders, the patches, the PhotoShop or Gimp layered files, the graphical elements and scans, even the preparatory sketches, the written score, the script, the character and plot descriptions, unfinished versions of the work. All this will allow other people to build on Open Content rather than just to recycle it. Physical media are no limit. Free Software began when programs had to be distributed on bulky magnetic tapes. Open Content doesn’t necessarily need the Internet; photocopies of sketches and scores are much better than no source material at all.<br />
Moving from Open Content to Open Source Material will enable a creative explosion in culture like the one that Free Software has enabled for programming. And for the same reason: shared source material improved and added to by a creative community that creators can build on.</p>

        The End Of Art Theory Is Not
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">01 Jul 2004</span>

    <p>This essay: <a href="http://www.hicgumanities.org/AHproceedings/Leon Rosenstein.pdf">The End of Art Theory</a>, argues that Art Theory is finished.<br />
It does this by trying to show that The Institutional Theory of art is untenable. The Institutional Theory, it claims, contains so many free terms that it is all-inclusive and unable to separate art from any other objects. It is circular to boot. In fact, the Institutional Theory is not a theory.<br />
Ironically, if this is true it means that the Institutional Theory is the only tenable post-Art-Theory means of identifying and considering art. If the Institutional Theory is not a theory, it can survive the End Of Art Theory. Worse, without any guiding theory to identify or evaluate art, identifying art becomes a matter of nomination, of saying that something is art. The Institutional Theory is based on nomination, and is slightly stronger than random nomination as it is underwritten by the social authority of those doing the nominating (the critics, theorists and curators of the Artworld).<br />
If this is the death of the Institutional Theory, it’s a Freddy Kreuger kind of death…</p>

    <p>From Vision Research vol 44 p1493 via NewScientist 26.6.04.</p>

<p>Adding visual noise to a picture of the Mona Lisa affected how people saw it. No, really. The scientists responsible for this study believe that the visual system’s own noise causes this effect. But anyone looking at the picture can see that if visual noise affects the picture, it -er- affects the picture. If the researchers don’t believe this, I have a project that involves adding random noise to their research grant budget figure…</p>
