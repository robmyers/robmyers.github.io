    <p>Pere Ubu (Pa Ubu) is the protagonist of several of French writer Alfred Jarry’s more absurdist plays. Ubu is a violent buffoon who is sometimes the King of Poland, sometimes a galley slave and always engaged in some scheme. On his enormous belly is a spiral, his umbilicus.</p>

<p>Here’s the logo of the popular Free Software distro Debian:</p>

<p>Yes, it’s an umbilicus.</p>

<p>There’s a very popular derivative of Debian called Ubuntu, which is allegedly named after a Bantu word. But given the density of wordplay in the Ubu plays we see that Ubuntu is actually a corruption of Ubu en tu, “Ubu in you”. Which reminds us of “Intel inside”, and given that the umbilicus-branded Debian is included, it is literally true. And probably rude.</p>

    <span class="post-date">08 May 2007</span>

    <p>Ubu Enchaine (Ubu Enchained) is the third of Alfred Jarry’s Pere Ubu (Pa Ubu) plays. After refusing to say “merdre”, Pere Ubu arrives in France sets himself against the ideal of liberty, demanding to be made a slave.</p>

<p>The effects of liberty can be seen in the behaviour of The Free Men of the French army. They assert their freedom through disobedience and contrariness, struggling to find the best way to not only disobey orders but to act differently from their comrades. They remain in an army that requires them to act freely, with their commander demanding that they not follow his orders properly, not entirely unaware of the contradictions that this entails.</p>

<p>Ubu’s slavery is as proactive. He attaches himself to various masters, deciding what is best for them and then doing it without being asked, thereby taking over their lives and imprisoning them. When taken to court for this he demands to be thrown in prison, where he will be free from society.</p>

<p>Soon others are inspired to join Ubu in the freedom of the prison and all the cannonballs in the kingdom are used for impromptu balls and chains. When the Free Men con a visiting English tourist into accepting Ubu as the King this is not entirely untrue. Ubu to all intents and purposes is running the country, the demands of his incarceration being met by enormous taxes.</p>

<p>Eventually Ubu demands that he be made a galley slave…</p>

        Fifty Years Of Hammer Horror

    <span class="post-date">07 May 2007</span>

    <p>“The Curse Of Frankenstein”, the first Hammer Horror film, was released on the second of May 1957. So it’s now fifty years old.Christopher Lee played the monster in that film and he’s still going strong, appearing recently in the Lord Of The Rings movies and the Star Wars prequels.For those of you reading this blog for the Free Culture side of things, the monsters in the Hammer films were public domain by the time Hammer were filming them, but Hammer signed a fifty-page licensing agreement with Universal Studios to make sure they could distribute the films in the US. Now that is scary. ;-)</p>

    <p>“Man is born in freedom but he soon becomes a slaveIn cages of convention from the cradle to the graveThe weak fall by the wayside but the strong will be savedIn a brave new world.”- The Artilleryman, “Jeff Waynes Musical Version Of War Of the Worlds”.There’s something wonderful about summing up everything that went wrong with the 20th century because of 19th century ideology in less than one verse. The Artilleryman’s description of his plan to the Journalist is wonderful because it makes clear the seductive logic of historicism in a way that invokes both communism and fascism equally.The title of this post is something else the Artilleryman says. It’s funnier if you say it while opening a bottle of the cheapest cava.</p>

        Dematerialization

    <span class="post-date">07 May 2007</span>

    <p>The market, like copyright and art theory, is an ontology of art, or at least some kind of substitute for one.<br />
Conceptualism dematerialized the art object in favour of its theoretical description, an ontology.<br />
The market has similarly dematerialized the artwork in favour of the entities and relationships that it posits, an ontology. How much? When? Who? Where? Who else?<br />
This is an impoverished ontology, the reliance on simple tags, numbers and data from outside of the artwork creates an ontological proxy for the artwork that has very little to do with the artwork qua artwork.<br />
But in any system of relations figures and grounds emerge and gain proportion and composition. And the physical artwork (even for relational works) remains as the grit in the pearl. Either is a point of friction and a possible point of critique. It’s just not clear what of.</p>
