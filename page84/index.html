        The Agile Artist 1 - Getting Things Done
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">06 Oct 2008</span>

    <p>The book “<a href="http://www.43folders.com/2004/09/08/getting-started-with-getting-things-done">Getting Things Done</a>” by David Allen describes an over-arching system for organizing work and life. It has two ideas that I think artists can use without adopting the system wholesale.</p>

<p>The first is to organize the working materials for projects into their own, physical, folders. Then when you need to return to the project you just get the folder and you immediately have all the materials you need to hand. Substitute “area of the studio”, “rack”, “drawer” or “portfolio” to taste.  You don’t need separate sketchbooks, and the system allows for an unsorted folder and other ways for ideas to mix and percolate.</p>

<p>The second is to break tasks down into quickly achievable “next actions”, ideally achievable in 20 minutes or less each. So rather than “make 20 paintings for the show”, “mark up the next canvas” or “sketch the cat”. Yes, much of the value of art is long periods of visual contemplation or creative “flow”. But you need to get there, and worrying about the big picture is less constructive than building up to that state slowly but surely.</p>

<p>There may be more in Getting Things Done of interest to individual artists, and its system is applicable to admin and other non-art work as well. It’s well worth a read.</p>

        Open Art History
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">01 Oct 2008</span>

    <p>Open Art History is a proposed project to gather and distribute<br />
reproductions of artworks and art historical documents. Art is a form of<br />
knowledge, and art history is a way of presenting that knowledge. Access<br />
to high quality reproductions of images of art and to literature &amp; data<br />
concerning art history is of great value to artists, critics, art<br />
historians, art theorists and educators.</p>

<p><a href="http://okfn.org/wiki/OpenArtHistory">http://okfn.org/wiki/OpenArtHistory</a></p>

<p>The initial aim of the project is to identify standards for data and image formats for projects.</p>

<p>The pilot project for Open Art History will be Open Hogarth. This is due<br />
to the availability and comparative ease of reproduction of Hogarth’s<br />
work, its social and historical relevance, its art historical<br />
importance, and its popularity with the general public. Hogarth’s<br />
literary nature is also a link to the Open Literature project, and his<br />
place in the history of the copyright of art makes him an interesting<br />
subject for a Free Knowledge project.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.knowledgeforge.net/project/openhogarth/">http://www.knowledgeforge.net/project/openhogarth/</a></p>

<p>The initial aim of the project is to find sources for high-quality<br />
digital photographs or scans of Hogarth etchings online.</p>

<p>If you have any comments or suggestions then please post to the okf-discuss list,<br />
join in the OKF IRC meeting on Wednesday, and/or add material to the OKF Wiki.</p>

        Art After Neoliberalism
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">30 Sep 2008</span>

    <p>In “Count Zero”, the 1986 sequel to his genre-defining cyberpunk novel “Neuromancer”, William Gibson described a gallery system based on ownership of shares in unimaginably expensive artworks circulating in the market.</p>

<p>Gibson’s Reagonomic future is almost our present. Pension funds for artists leverage collections of artworks, loans are offered against artworks by banks, and the super-rich use artworks as market-index-beating commodities. But in Gibson’s future the artwork was still a painting, and the market stopped at the frame.</p>

<p>Neoliberalism’s “market” is an indexical environment, the “information” it contains is linked to real-world effects with ethical import. Like the representations of art, market information is based on “figures”, and like art those figures can be positive and negative and create meaning by interrelation. Leverage is a form of abstraction. And financial vehicles are compositions of abstracted figures.</p>

<p>This isn’t to say that the FTSE 100 creates a line so economics is a form of drawing. It is to say that the market has form and aesthetics.</p>

<p>Leveraging the value not of artworks but of classes of artworks is simple. Create an Impressionist fund. They already exist. But this stops at the frame. If the market is truly the undeniable gravitational rule of the age, it should reach into the artwork.</p>

<p>An artwork consists of figures and their relations with aesthetic properties and iconographic qualities.</p>

<p>Leveraging the value of aesthetic properties or iconographic/semiotic entities is simple once it is recognized that the economic and art historical value of an artwork can vary based on their relative cachet. Aesthetic financial instruments/vehicles can reach into and across artworks, collaterolizing changes in the value of their form, content and subject.</p>

<p>This raises the possibilities of shorting, asset stripping, penny shares, spam, gold farming and other exploits within the market for aesthetic/semiotic/iconographic vehicles. Since these economic developments are tied to the artworks, they will be developments within the artworks as well.</p>

<p>This means that the vehicles will affect the artworks as well as the artworks affecting the vehicles. I don’t mean that the artworks should be visualizations of the figures of the vehicles. I mean that the artworks will be affected by these. This is a particularly pure representation of the neoliberal fantasy. Art is the place for such things.</p>

<p>Art shows things as they are known to be rather than as they actually are, whether the mediaeval end of the world or individual liberty. Jeff Koons’s carefully priced sculptures and Danica Phelps’s money stripes are precursors to an art that does not represent the aesthetics of neoliberal economics but is represented by them.</p>

<p>Hot stock, blue on gold…</p>

    <p><a href="http://cellobela.com/">Bela Emerson</a>’s cybernetic cello performances are excellent. New album out soon!</p>

<p><a href="http://bradsucks.net/">Brad Sucks</a> is mis-named. His college-radio-friendly Beck-ish rock wouldn’t normally be my cup of tea but it’s BY-SA and it grows on you.</p>
