    <p>A helpless, fearful despair<br />
that I have not felt for a quarter of a century.<br />
A vertiginous clarity of the flow of patterns of all things that I have not seen in fifteen years.</p>

    <p>Two “Open” literary projects.</p>

<p>NewsGrist on an author opening up some of his stories for playwrights:</p>

<p><a href="http://newsgrist.typepad.com/underbelly/2007/01/jonathan_lethem.html">Jonathan Lethem Goes Open Source</a></p>

<p>It’s an excellent move. Why he isn’t using a CC licence is beyond me, though.</p>

<p>And Penguin Books are experimenting with writing a book through a wiki:</p>

<p><a href="http://thepenguinblog.typepad.com/the_penguin_blog/2007/02/a_million_pengu.html">A Million Penguins </a></p>

<p>Ghost authorship, multiple authorship and finishing services for books are common, and movie &amp; TV scripts are written by teams, so with a good model to follow there is no reason why novels shouldn’t be written by a competent team.</p>

<p>Wikipedia would be a terrible model for writing a book, a giant uncoordinated game of Exquisite Corpse.</p>

<p>The Linux Kernel would be an excellent model for writing a book. Competent contributors working to an understood design with their contributions being audited and accepted or rejected by competent integrators.</p>

        Artists Should Work

    <span class="post-date">21 Jan 2007</span>

    <p><a href="http://books.guardian.co.uk/poetry/features/0,,1994304,00.html">Laura Barton talks to the high priestess of punk, Patti Smith | By genre | Guardian Unlimited Books<br />
</a><br />
_ Smith is nothing if not a grafter. She prickles at the modern notion of rock as a glamorous vocation, of stars made overnight, of the MTV generation’s iPodded consumerism. “You have to kick doors open yourself. When people come up to me and say, ‘Patti, nobody wants to hear my CD and I don’t have enough money for equipment,’ I say, ‘Well, get a job, y’know?’ That’s what I did. You get people who say, ‘The government won’t give me a grant and I can’t do my art.’ I say, ‘Fuck you, it’s your own fault, you expect the government to give you a hand? The government is corrupt. Do what it takes. You do babysitting jobs, you work in the factory, you work in the bookstore or become a pickpocket, y’know? But whatever. Get a job.’ Work is really good for an artist.” Her features sharpen and there is a fierce set to her mouth. “My son is one of the best guitar players I’ve ever heard. And how does he make his money? He does manual labour, he does landscaping, he digs ditches. He’s out there sometimes eight to 12 hours a day because he lives in Detroit and it’s hard to get work there. But it’s good, it’s good. Artists should work.” _</p>

<p>MTAA rather miss the point of Cory Doctorow and his comments on the Cloud Gate fiasco.<br />
Calling for an Anish Kapoor sculpture to be melted down for scrap is usually the sign of a healthy mind. Unless it’s one of his powderier confections, obviously. Anyone who finds calling for the destruction of an artwork disturbing really needs to read up on their art history beyond The Culture Wars.<br />
Calling for an Anish Kapoor sculpture to be melted down for scrap in the course of a battle over public space and representation, issues that are key to art and society, is<br />
simply a rhetorical expression of strongly held opinion over those issues. And as someone who cares passionately about art, I would say in all seriousness that if a work of art is that harmful to society (in a practical rather than a symbolic way), destroying it is the less harmful option for art itself.</p>
