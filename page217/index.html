        Creative Block
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">15 Feb 2006</span>

    <p>I don’t think I really have a creative block. Just not enough time and too much real life stress.</p>

<p>I was going to do some image remixing this month but that is turning out to be a bigger project than I thought. I’ll have to take more time to prepare it thoroughly. I’m also very concerned that it must not be an academic or merely political exercise. If bad art comes from the best of intentions, illustrating theory makes for abject drivel.</p>

<p>I’d like to do more on draw-something, ahead of schedule. The colour images and the valentines hacks show how well it is coming on. But I need to know what draw-something is going to do next. Maybe better colour, maybe better composition, maybe better forms. Maybe I should just get on with it.</p>

<p>I think I will retreat to my sketchbook for a while. And maybe blog a little. Sitting at the Wacom staring at a blank screen isn’t helping. :-)</p>

<p>I’ll make pages for ds and paintr in time, but I just needed to remind myself how much I’ve achieved over the last year (and this year already) given my current creative block. :-)</p>

<p>== Subject Matter ==</p>

<p>This forum will focus on ‘open content’, that is works such as books,<br />
music, and films which are provided under terms that allow for free<br />
access, redistribution and re-use.</p>

<p>Open ‘content’ it would seem is everywhere what with Yahoo announcing<br />
there were over 50 million web pages licensed under Creative Commons,<br />
Microsoft teaming up with the British Library to digitize 100,000 out of<br />
copyright books (under the aegis of the Open Content Alliance), and the<br />
BBC piloting the Creative Archive project which will make large sections<br />
of its back catalogue available for free online.</p>

<p>The forum provides a chance to discuss these dramatic changes as well as<br />
to ask important questions such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>What exactly does ‘open’ mean? Does it mean ‘full’ freedom to<br />
access, redistribute and re-use or are restrictions such as those in CC<br />
non-commercial licenses allowed?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How should we promote the creation and distribution of open content?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Who will be producing open content and how will it be funded?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will there be an ‘open content’ revolution</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To what extent do monopoly rights such as copyright hinder, or<br />
help, the development of open content?</p>
  </li>
</ul>
