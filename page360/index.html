        Drawing People

    <p>There’s the objection to drawing people that you cannot know what another person is thinking or doing, so seeking to represent them is misrepresentation, projection, falsehood. For me, drawing people is the opposite of this. People are unknowable, you have to admit this to draw them, you admit this <em>by</em> drawing them. Drawing them is dealing with the unknowable. There’s a sense of wonder in all this, you can’t be arrogant, there’s no possibility of divine revelation underwriting it.<br />
What am I drawing when I’m drawing people? I don’t know. But I wish that I could.</p>

    <p>Work like Gips &amp; Stiny’s hand painted shape grammars or Harold Cohen’s AARON <strong>_is _</strong>creative, as the problems and solutions are identified in the creation of the work and the resulting style is necessary and historically unprecedented. H-creative, in Margaret Boden’s terminology.</p>

    <p>The fact that some programs can produce variations on existing styles (usually Kandinsky or Mondrian) does not show that programs can be creative. The mechanisation of an existing style in humans shows a <em>lack</em> of creativity. The creation of new styles (the discovering and solving of new problems) is the hallmark of creativity, as long as the results are Realistic for the conditions of their production.</p>

    <p>One advantage of using programs to make art is that the results are “proofs” of the theory of artistic production embodied in the program. Like the proofs of a mathematical theory, or the proofs of an etching. Or like an aesthetic Turing test, if a human being can’t tell the difference between a drawing made by a program and one made by another human being, the program has been proven to be successfully reproducing a human level of artistic production.</p>

        Bait And Switch

    <p>Totalitarian art is brought to the attention by extra-aesthetic means; its association with and dissemination by totalitarianism. It might not otherwise be noteworthy. Any attempt to turn a somehow made-innocent eye on it to find aesthetic value in it is rehabilitating its extra-aesthetic aspect, not its aesthetics. <br />
To do so is a bait-and-switch:<br />
1. An object that is aesthetically uninteresting is given prominence.<br />
2. It is suggested that since this object has prominence it may be aesthetic.<br />
3. It is suggested that this is independent of its extra-aesthetic qualities.<br />
4. Voila! An unaesthetic object of interest only because it has been peddled by totalitarianism is rendered an object of aesthetic regard.</p>
