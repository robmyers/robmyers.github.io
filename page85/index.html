    <span class="post-date">29 Sep 2008</span>

    <p>When I was at art school, two of my colleagues found a wall from a<br />
demolished building on some wasteland out of town that would have made<br />
an excellent canvas for a mural they were planning. But it was covered<br />
in graffiti. Real graffiti by kids with spraycans, not<br />
destined-for-publication graphic designer posturing. To make their<br />
mural they would have had to destroy it.</p>

<p>One of them later acknowledged to me that they’d done the right thing by not doing so.</p>

<p>The excellent Art Fag City blog comments on Marisa Olson’s contribution to the “Surf Clubs” debate. AFC agrees with some of what Marisa says, then comments -</p>

<blockquote>_I don't understand why reposting material without attribution on a blog  
should take the work out of circulation, or remove a pre-existing  
narrative/economy. Sure they carry a different authority when posted  
by a well respected net artist, but this doesn't negate their history,  
nor is it any way distinctive from the mechanisms of other online  
social networks. After all, an influential DIGG member carries  
authority too._  
</blockquote>

<p>For me it is this ventriloquism, and the assumption that artists are somehow doing it better, that is part of the ethical and aesthetic problem of Surf Clubs. And if Surf Clubs are just an accurate representation of the means of production and social relations of Web 2.0, why are they so reliant on the artworld reputations of their contributors?</p>

<blockquote>_Dr. Malotki's latest focus is on designs called phosphenes, which are  
as fundamental to art as time is to language. He said the same 15  
abstract geometric constants appear globally in art created as early as  
300,000 years ago. They are grids, zigzags and patterns of dots. They  
are the first objects drawn by children; we doodle them when we talk on  
the phone._  
  
</blockquote>

<p>These are the same kind of rock drawings that inspired Harold Cohen in the 1970s with AARON. And if you look at AARON’s drawings from the late 1970s you’ll see precisely these phosphenic forms (among others) being created by the program. Cohen called AARON’s repertoire of the time “cognitive primitives”. Malotki’s work seems to bear this out.</p>

    <p>As capitalism does another ideological reset the excuse du jour is that the credit crunch was a highly improbable event, a “black swan” (it’s not just a bad song by Thom Yhork).</p>

<p>If this is true then the people who sold unsustainable mortgages to get the commission on them then sold them on rather than take on the risk of those mortgages were behaving irrationally, because they could not have foreseen that anyone would default on them. This would raise more questions than it answers.</p>

<p>The problem isn’t probability. The sub-prime market was exploited in the way it was because of its probabilities, not despite them. The problem is greed. And self-pitying denial won’t disguise that, however dense the notation.</p>

        GNU Is 25 Today
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">27 Sep 2008</span>

    <p>It’s the twenty-first anniversary of the announcement of the GNU project today. GNU is a project to create a Free Software operating system, that is software for your computer that does not allow other people to restrict your freedom to use it.</p>

<p>I’m writing this on a laptop running Fedora, which is a Free Software distribution based on GNU. I’m writing it in Firefox, also Free Software, using Movable Type, again Free Software, running on a Free Software web server.</p>

<p>From almost no Free Software a quarter of a century ago to pervasive Free Software today. There is always more work to be done, and new threats to the freedom to use software freely, but GNU has been a great success. Never let anyone tell you that pragmatism is more important or more powerful than ethics.</p>

<p>Happy birthday GNU!</p>
