        DDOS, Aesthetics, Speech

    <p>Distributed Denial Of Service attacks have a form. They have a political form, and they have a spatial form. The latter is the network topography of the attacks. At present the spatial form (and its properties) are incidental, but it is possible to make them part of the political message. This could make the form of the DDOS political speech and/or artistic expression.</p>

<p>Firstly the specific servers and the clients accessing them can be chosen for their geographic position using a system such as GeoLite. Shapes, diagrams and letters can be drawn in this way to communicate a specific message above and beyond the mere fact of the attack.</p>

<p>Secondly the properties of the network traffic sent to the servers can be varied to encode a message. The timing of messages can be used to transmit values and thereby numbers, text, images and even sound or video although the latter would be very slow.</p>

<p>The problems with these schemes are that the variation of traffic volume involved in structuring the messages, the topography of the Internet and the effects of the DDOS attack itself would work to destroy the coherency of the encoded messages. This functions as a commentary on or allegory for the effectiveness of reasoned argument versus simple rage.</p>

<p>Attacks of these kinds could be simulated using virtual machines on a closed network. This would function as a proof of concept and as art. Capturing and visualizing the network traffic of the attack would serve to recover the intended message or to track its degradation, and again would function as art.</p>

        SendValues
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">09 Sep 2011</span>

    <p>SendValues is a network testing tool that sends mathematical, aesthetic and textual values using the properties of rather than the contents of network messages.</p>

<p>You can get the source code here: <a href="https://gitorious.org/robmyers/values-sender">https://gitorious.org/robmyers/values-sender</a></p>

<p>Both a stand-alone command-line version and an IRC-client version are included.</p>

<p>SendValues uses a naive pulse-width-modulation scheme for encoding values. Any improvements to the code gratefully received.</p>

<p>Here is the README:</p>

<p>SendValues is a system for transmitting aesthetic expression and political speech using properties of network protocols.</p>

<p>There are two versions, a command-line client and an IRC client. They use the same code and concepts apart from their different interfaces.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Concepts</li>
</ul>

<p>** Senders</p>

<p>A sender is a way of sending information over the network using an IP-based protocol. SendValues has the following senders:</p>

<p>TCP - Sends messages as TCP/IP connections.<br />
UDP - Sends messages as UDP packets.<br />
SYN - Sends messages as SYN requests.<br />
HTTP - Sends messages as HTTP requests.<br />
PING - Sends messages as ICMP echo requests.</p>

<p>Senders may be specified to the command line or IRC clients by these names.</p>

<p>** Values</p>

<p>A value is a message to be sent to a host using a sender. Values are quantized by the sender and transmitted over the network as naive pulse width modulation values.</p>

<p>SINE - A sine wave (argument is number of steps).<br />
SQUARE - A square wave (argument is number of steps).<br />
SAWTOOTH - A sawtooth wave (argument is number of steps).<br />
TRIANGLE - A triangle wave (argument is number of steps).<br />
TEXT - A block of text (argument is text to send).<br />
IMAGE - An image, to be sent as 1-bit pbm data (argument is image URL).</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Command Line Client</li>
</ul>

<p>The command line client takes all of its arguments from the command line.</p>

<p>-h, –help - Print the help and exit.<br />
-o, –host  - The host address to send to.<br />
-s, –sender - The sender to use (from the list above).<br />
-m, –method - The values generation method to use (from the list above).<br />
-a, –argument - The argument to the values generation method.<br />
-c, –cell - How long each value takes to send (in milliseconds).<br />
-d, –duration - How long to send values to the host.</p>

<p>These all have default values, including host which defaults to localhost.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The IRC Client</li>
</ul>

<p>The IRC client takes its initial configuration from the command line. Once it has connected to an IRC channel it takes commands from messages on that channel.</p>

<p>Command line arguments:</p>

<p>-h, –help - Print the help and exit.<br />
-s, –server - The IRC server to connect to.<br />
-p, –port - The port on the IRC server to use (defaults to 6667).<br />
-c, –channel - The channel on the server to take commands from (omit #).<br />
-u, –user - The user on the channel to take commands from.</p>

<p>Channel and user default to “artcommands”.</p>

<p>Commands to the IRC channel have the following formats:</p>

<p>START [sender:]host[:port] kind[:argument]</p>

<p>Start sending values of the given kind to host using sender.<br />
Where only sender or port are specified, the clients will guess which.<br />
Argument can be a number of steps for wave senders, a url for the image sender, or arbitrary text for the text sender.</p>

<p>STOP host</p>

<p>Stop sending to the host. The host must be specified exactly as it was in the START command</p>

<p>STOP</p>

<p>Stop sending to all hosts.</p>

    <span class="post-date">09 Sep 2011</span>

    <p>The mind senses, learns, feels, communicates. But software supplants the capabilites of mind. GPS is a super-human sense, Wikipedia and stackoverflow are knowledge, Facebook and match.com are affect, Twitter and tumblr are communication.</p>

<p>The mind is obsolete.</p>

    <p>Skeuomorphs are ornamental design elements that retain the structure of their functional precursors:</p>

<p><a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Skeuomorph">https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Skeuomorph</a></p>

<p>There are two senses in which humanity is a skeuomorph.</p>

<p>The first is that the quality of humanity, of being human, is irrelevant to social networking and its streams. Attaching human concepts and identities to streams is skeuomorphic, and Real Names policies only underline this.</p>

<p>The second is more quantitative. Capital, corporations and their algorithms do not need human beings, they are optimizing humanity out. But to the extent that they do still need to interact with human beings, they use skeuomorphic human forms such as CEOs and quants.</p>

<p>Humanity is a skeuomorph.</p>

    <p><img src="/assets/sa-shapes.png" alt="Streaming Aesthetics: Shapes" /><br />
Here’s the code for Streaming Aesthectics: Shape . You can compile and run it in Processing.</p>

<p><a href="https://gitorious.org/robmyers/streaming-aesthetics">https://gitorious.org/robmyers/streaming-aesthetics</a></p>

<p>It follows Twitter to see when people tweet shape names and then draws those shapes, packing them inside each other.</p>

<p>There’s some unused code for more complex shapes, but “star” and “cross” appear in the Twitter firehose more often than geometric shape names.</p>

<p>Next is Streaming Aesthetics: Pattern .</p>
