        Fixing The LeWitt 4x4 Set Comprehension

    <p>I got the LeWitt set comprehensions wrong. I’ve fixed the others (I edited this blog without declaring it, I feel unclean…) but the 4 line, 4 colour one was a bit harder. Here’s a sketch for the fixed version.
    C = {r,y,b,k}
    L = {|, \, /, -}
    V = C x L = {(r, |), … (k, -)}
    W = PV = {{(r, |)}, .. {(r, |), … (k, -)}}
    X = {x :âˆˆ W | #x &gt; 0 ^ #x &lt; 5} % All sets of 1..4
    Y = {x :âˆˆ X | #x = # U (U x) } % All sets with unique first pair items
    Z = {x :âˆˆ Y, y :âˆˆ x • U (U y)} % Each item of each member set combined
    Alternative Z:Z = {x :âˆˆ Y • U (U x)} % Each member set combined</p>

        Is That It?

    <p>Free Culture is just freedom of speech. Is that it?</p>

<p>As Lessig so eloquently explains in “Free Culture”, we have been facing a perfect storm of factors that act to limit, among other things, free speech. Since “Free Culture” was written we have faced further governmental and economic reductions in the possibility of pluralism in the US and the UK (where I am). Protecting freedom of speech is vital to protecting pluralism and to keeping our societies open. This is hardly a side issue.</p>

<p>Negative free speech can be aided by lobbying for legal reform and by activism against state, corporate and community closure and capture of public debate.</p>

<p>Positive free speech can be aided by economic, technological and social innovation and organization.</p>

<p>So freedom of speech doesn’t reduce the challenges or limit the options, it clarifies and underwrites them for both activists and entrepeneurs.</p>

<p>And “speech” isn’t just speech.</p>

<p>A journalist once chided Lessig for an example from “Free Culture”. A group of kids were given access to video production equipment, allowing them to document and communicate their situation in a way that was, for them, unprecedented. The journalist asked why they couldn’t just pick up guitars, accusing Lessig of technological reification.</p>

<p>Even assuming they could afford guitars the answer would be no different: because the public conversation that shapes our society today is formed in the media. A democracy cannot and must not have a media underclass. Freedom of speech means the freedom to participate in the discussion of society as peers in whatever form that discussion takes. That form is changing faster today than ever, and keeping that conversation open is vital.</p>

        What Is Free Culture? (Again)

    <p>Free Culture[1] is the culture of an Open Society[2]. An open society must be Pluralistic[3]. Freedom of Speech[4] is a necessary condition for pluralism.</p>

<p>Freedom of speech can be Negatively and Positively[5] supported.</p>

<p>Negative support is lack of legal and institutional opposition to free speech. Traditionally this means lack of government censorship, but as media and corporations mediate social relations ever increasingly this means law and institutional power as it relates to all players in society.</p>

<p>Positive support is economic and technological support for free speech. Traditionally this has meant innovations in the physical means of reproduction and the legal means of charging for it.</p>

<p>In this scheme, alternative licensing schemes are a technology, albeit a legal technology.</p>

<p>It could be argued that P2P is negative support rather than positive innovation; it removes legal and institutional opposition to free exchange. This shows that these categories must be dynamic. It also shows that positive and negative freedom can be in tension. Berlin or Mill[6] are helpful in considering this.</p>

        Code And Speech As Text

    <p>Cultural works are not functional, and so do not require the same defence of use value as software does.</p>

<p>But software is represented as, and legally protected as, text.</p>

<p>The mechanisms and arguments used to protect the freedom to work with the text of the software apply to the text qua text. They are therefore available to arguments regarding the freedom to work with text in general.</p>

<p>Speech is encoded in text much the same as software is; both speech and code are “uses” of text. If these uses should both be free for their own reasons then the same arguments and mechanisms for supporting this freedom can be used for both.</p>

<p>The mechanisms that free software uses when protecting software freedom can therefore be used to protect freedom of speech. This despite the fact that software use and speech are very different acts.</p>

<p>Software, as the expression of functionality rather than as functionality itself, can be thought of as a form of speech, and indeed this is the conclusion that the EFF encryption free speech case reached.</p>

<p>Stallman does differentiate between the freedoms that he believes are needed by functional works, works of opinion and works of expression. But I am arguing that his “four freedoms” should be applied to the texts of free speech as well as to the texts of free software for different reasons, not that cultural works are functional.</p>

        Why should the licence of an artwork be interesting?
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">21 Jun 2007</span>

    <p><a href="http://www.mtaa.net/mtaaRR/news/twhid/artificial_legal_add_ons_to_art.html">http://www.mtaa.net/mtaaRR/news/twhid/artificial_legal_add_ons_to_art.html</a></p>

<p>Most artworks have a legal status as copyrighted works, as designs, or at the very least as insured objects. Some, such as works by Carey Young, are legal documents themselves. The law provides a kind of ontology for artworks. But unreproducable artworks are more interesting when the unreproducability is a technical rather than a legal effect.</p>

<p>Artworks often have certificates of authenticity, and contracts and guarantees were the stuff of 1960s conceptualism. Sales documents are important in establishing provenance, and recipts are important when filing tax returns. But usually the paperwork of an artwork is of peripheral interest at best.</p>

<p>Alternative licenses are not part of the legal orthodoxy of society though. They are a signal of dissent (or at least a desire for reform). They are political to a degree. Applying one to a work is a small political act.</p>

<p>The political commitments of artists are more often a cause of embarrassment than an interesting component of the work even genetically. For every David a dozen surrealist members of the communist party. And a David. The political commitment of artists is too often empty, and empty-headed, gestures. “Career building bullshit that cares” as Art &amp; Language said.</p>

<p>The difference with alternative licenses is that art is directly implicated in “The Copyfight”. This is not political volunteerism, these are issues that actually affect art. The production and consumption of art is part of the debate. Warhol, Koons, Garnett and others have all been bitten by copyright. Christo, the owners of a work by Kapoor, and others have all bitten others with copyright.</p>

<p>In an open society it is vital that we not allow the closing off of artistic freedom through the legal means that alternative licences are a protection against. We cannot force Magnum photographers or toy manufacturers to adopt the same licence, but we can use our own adoption as a reason why they should. We can take a stand for our principles that affects us for a change.</p>

<p>Commitment is bad for art because it limits artistic freedom. But the copyfight is commitment to artistic freedom. And alternative licenses are a tactic in the copyfight. Using one is a sign of commitment to a non-artistic cause, a limit on artistic freedom. But that non-artistic cause is the cause of removing limits on artistic freedom.</p>

<p>This is reflexive, or at least a kind of loop. It has something to do with the genetic character of the work and its aesthetics. Where a work is concerned with aesthetic freedom, and few modernist or postmodernist works are not, the licence of the artwork may not be part of the visual aesthetics of the work but it will impinge on the experience and effect of it.</p>

<p>The reception of a work and what is known about it can affect what is seen in it. Nelson Goodman uses a work’s status as a fake as an example of this, and cites elements of fake Vermeers that are obvious to us now but that weren’t obvious when they were first seen. DJ Spooky describes remixes as “interrogation of meaning”. The licensing of a work can prevent its reproduction and thereby its analysis and discussion of it, and can prevent remixing of it, to the point where its content or meaning are unrealized or unextended. This is an aesthetic loss for the work.</p>

<p>The licence of an artwork is interesting because even if it cannot make a work look better it can make the work be seen better and can lead to the creation of better work. This is not incidental to art or to artworks, it is part of the very conditions of their existence. The canvas of a painting isn’t interesting until you wonder what would happen if it wasn’t there.</p>
