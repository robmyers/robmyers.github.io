    <p>Due to an unlikely series of events I’m going to be in Boston and Cambridge, Massachusetts from Friday 20th to Monday 23rd of March. Amongst other things I’ll be at the FSF’s <a href="http://www.fsf.org/associate/meetings/2009/">Libre Planet</a> conference.</p>

<p>If you’ll be in the area or at the convention you can contact me using the comments here, identi.ca, twitter, facebook or email where I am always “robmyers”, although for email you need to add rob@ … .org .</p>

<p>And if you won’t be in the area but you’ve any questions regarding network service freedom or the FSF’s high priority projects add them in the comments.</p>

        Code is the Easy Part

    <p>I once offended some BBC backstage hackers by claiming that the hardware and software for an online media service was the easy part. I didn’t mean to imply that making and maintaining a large datacentre to serve audio and video streams to hundreds of thousands of users is easy, quite the opposite. It’s just that the even compared to such a striking technological achievement, the contractual negotiations with rightsholders are a harder problem.</p>

<p>Spotify is an authorised subscription-based streaming music service that has solved the harder problem. I can find tracks by even mid-level obscure indie acts from 20 years ago on it and listen to them safe in the knowledge that the BPI won’t threaten my kids. But the server and client software are proprietary.</p>

<p>That is silly. The software is easy to reimplement, as the Despotify free software client demonstrates. The secret sauce for Spotify is the licence agreements. They can make the client free software and the server a free network service without endangering those agreements. In fact doing so will increase the value of them, as they will grow and retain the audience for their brand and for their provision of music covered by those agreements.</p>

<p>If Spotify let a thousand projects bloom based on their source code, they could find themselves selling picks and shovels rather than panning for gold. Selling subscriptions to copyright licenced music isn’t particularly a good thing for free culture, but a service that means listeners don’t get sued and musicians are at least in with a chance of getting paid is good. And if it is based on free software and free network services, it can be even better for everyone.</p>

        Why 3D Printing Will Go Mainstream

    <p><a href="http://replicatorinc.com/blog/2009/03/why-3d-printers-won%E2%80%99t-go-mainstream/">http://replicatorinc.com/blog/2009/03/why-3d-printers-won%E2%80%99t-go-mainstream/</a></p>

<p>Couldn’t resist. Sorry.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>It’s debatable whether publishing on demand has gone mainstream, but word processing, webogs and inkjet printers certainly have.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Plastics are complex but so is colour printing. If you can do even a small subset of what professional 3D printing needs with just 3-4 compounds then 3D printing can be the inkjets of manufacture.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Laser printers <em>used</em> to be expensive. Now mono ones are less than 100 pounds and colour ones are less than 200 pounds. Innovation and economies of scale can work wonders.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Plastics are large and intricate but then so were electronic components. RISC and miniaturization can work in both cases. You can fit a jigsaw in a smaller box than a poster, and it can be more instructive to put together.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Designing in 3D is really hard but this is what “commons based peer production” is for. Make 3D design copyleft and it may still be hard but it will be decomposible and improvable. Make copyleft distros of fabbable components and objects made from them and watch them grow.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>3D printing won’t go mainstream any more than home photocopiers did. But we will get the Kinko’s, Lulu.com, YouTube and HP Deskjets of 3D printing, and these will change things as much as the Internet and free software have.</p>

<p>Fail. The GPL isn’t “open content”, and “open content” presupposes the<br />
“content industry” as a frame of reference. “Free culture” is a<br />
better description, but…</p>

<blockquote>_that require derived works to be made available under the same

<p>NC-SA is not a free culture licence. And NC-SA is not copyleft either<br />
because it does not fully pass on the right to use and distribute the work.</p>

<p>It should be a precondition of getting Arts Council funding that work be<br />
BY-SA so that the public get full access to the work that they have paid for…</p>
