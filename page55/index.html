        Processing Code Community Site Licencing

    <p><a href="http://processing.org/">Processing</a> is an art computing environment that has the (dis)advantage of being based on Java and capable of running in any web browser with a non-free Java plugin (which really needs fixing, guys). There are better languages and environments for art computing, but there are none with greater mindshare or more active communities.</p>

<p>There are a couple of websites that allow you to create, upload and share Processing “sketches” (programs), which is great. Processing was designed in part as a successor to the “Design By Numbers” educational graphics programming environment, and its use in design and generative art makes sharing code good for the progress and development of culture.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sketchpatch.net/">sketchPatch</a></p>

<p>sketchPatch is very easy to use and allows you to write, compile and run Processing sketches in the browser. Sketches are licenced under Creative Commons’s Attribution-only licence. Which CC don’t recomment for code. MIT or the revised BSD licence would be better for a permissive/gift/psuedo-public-domain licence, and the GPL would be better for ensuring that people can use the code they contribute and build on.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.openprocessing.org/">OpenProcessing</a></p>

<p>OpenProcessing allows you to upload and share your sketches. The licencing is better than sketchPad - code is GPL the graphical output of the code presented on the website is BY-SA. But they do need to make it clear that the code is GPLv3 or later, and that BY-SA covers the non-code assets rather than the code, and that output from sketches is only BY-SA if presented on the site or it incorporates pre-existign BY-SA assets.</p>

<p>Neither site is <a href="http://autonomo.us/2008/07/franklin-street-statement/">Franklin Street</a> free, you can’t get the source code for the websites/web services themselves.</p>

<p>Both sites are great resources for digital artists and designers. Tuning up the presentation of their licences, and ensuring they are free network services, would future proof them for their creators and their audiences.</p>

        The Cybernetic Artworld
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">31 Dec 2009</span>

    <p><a href="/art/cybernetic_artworld/">/art/cybernetic_artworld/</a></p>

<p>In 1952, a century after Ada Lovelace suggested that computing machinery might be used to write musical scores, the first text generation program was written at the University Of Manchester. It was a love letter generator. Which I was completely unaware of in 2003 when I wrote “The Cybernetic Artwork Nobody Wrote”.</p>

<p>“Cybernetic…” was a Flash program that generated textual descriptions of simple abstract figure/ground visual compositions. The title came from an ironic 1970s code art piece I’d seen in an Art &amp; Language catalogue, and the idea came from the random poetry generators I’d seen in an Usborne children’s book about programming in the early 1980s. It’s a computer art historical intervention, an artwork that as far as I know nobody created but that someone really should have.</p>

<p>I wrote a Common Lisp version a couple of years later but it was still intended as an art historical project. There was a comment in a review of a computer art history book I read a while ago that talked about artists working after their (techno-)historical moment, and in the era of collective intelligence, statistical methods, data visualisation and big data, text generators are passe. But then so was woodcut in the era of cubism, and that difference was used constructively by the expressionists.</p>

<p>What suddenly made a possible virtue of Cybernetic’s simplicity and brevity was the emergence of microblogging services such as Twitter, which reduced the affective and semantic bandwidth available to would-be Turing Testers to 140 characters. Cybernetic could take part in the ambient chatter of the Twitosphere. Or the Dentosphere - I used the Free identi.ca (now Status Net) replacement for the proprietary Twitter service.</p>

<p>Earlier in 2009 I’d abandoned a couple of projects to simulate a parodic toy artworld visually or textually, but the simplicity, programmability, and social context of microblogging services allowed me to plan out what looked like an achievable version. An artist bot would microblog descriptions of possible artworks, a curator would blog references to those that made it into a show, a critic would blog evaluations of those works, and a collector bot would buy any that the critic identified as masterpieces. This would provide the artist with feedback to modify its aesthetic.</p>

<p>The curator and the feedback loop haven’t been implemented (yet), but the artist/critic/collector social network are a perfect toy embodiment of precisely how the artworld doesn’t work. They all run on the same server but the critic and the collector really do parse the output that they seem to. And they are running constantly, although I have to restart them when they crash or the server is restarted without my knowledge.</p>

<p>The Cybernetic Artworld is satire, both of art criticism and academia that takes the artworld’s self-image seriously and of the still current idea of relational art. It’s socialised aesthetic form, aestheticised social form. It’s a bit of fun. But it works, it’s aesthetically and conceptually rewarding, and it has critical content.</p>

    <p>In January <a href="http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4671426/FLOSS_Art_v1.1">the sources for Goto 10’s “Floss+Art” book</a> were released, which feature the expanded version of my essay “Open Source Art Again”.</p>

<p>In March I went to <a href="http://www.fsf.org/associate/meetings/2009/">the FSF’s “Libre Planet” conference</a>, which was great. Thanks to Mako for the sofa!</p>

<p>In December I went to <a href="http://goto10.org/make-art-2009/">Goto 10’s “Make Art” conference</a> to talk about Foocorp’s <a href="http://libre.fm/">libre.fm</a> project, which went live in April.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.furtherfield.org/">Furtherfield</a> continued to publish <a href="http://www.furtherfield.org/display_user.php?ID=467">my reviews</a>. I find writing reviews very hard, and it’s always good when I get feedback, I think my most popular review on that basis was <a href="http://www.furtherfield.org/displayreview.php?review_id=337">the one of Pall Thayer’s excellent Microcodes.</a></p>

<p>CIAC published some <a href="http://www.ciac.ca/magazine/archives/no_33/oeuvre4.htm">different</a> <a href="http://www.ciac.ca/magazine/archives/no_34/oeuvre5.htm">reviews</a>, which gave me a good chance to review work I wouldn’t have had a chance to otherwise.</p>

<p>And I finished a good number of projects, including <a href="/art/cybernetic_artworld/">The Cybernetic Artworld</a>, <a href="/the_colour_of_news">The Colour Of News</a>, <a href="/the_colour_of">The Colour Of</a>, the code for the <a href="http://www.demographicreplicator.com/">Demo Graphic Replicators</a>, and <a href="/art/random_aesthetics">Random Aesthetics</a>.</p>

<p>A big thank you to everyone whose material and moral support made this all possible. I feel very lucky to have got to do so much good stuff this year. I hope to do even more next year.</p>

    <p>Donate your old laptops to help Furtherfield with the Zero Dollar Laptop project!</p>

<p>In order to become a Zero Dollar Laptop your old laptop will need:-</p>

<ul>
  <li>a working screen</li>
  <li>processor-a minumum 1GHz Pentium 3, Athlon, Celeron.</li>
  <li>256 (but more ideally 512) ram</li>
  <li>wireless card would be helpful

    <p>I’ve hopefully restored the formatting on the older entries in this blog.</p>

<p>Comment formatting couldn’t be recovered this time, hopefully I’ll be able to get it back at some point in the future.</p>
