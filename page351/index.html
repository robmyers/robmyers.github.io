        Open Clip Art

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">02 Jun 2004</span>

    <p>There is now an Open Clip Art project:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.openclipart.org/">http://www.openclipart.org/</a></p>

<p>The only license they use is Public Domain, which I understand from a commercial point of view, but it would have been nicer to have a choice of the <a href="http://www.creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> licenses. I’d add my work if I could CC it.</p>

<p>There’s nothing to stop you taking the work and combining it with your own work to make something that you then CC. That’s the disadvantage of the Public Domain: you can steal from it. But this can work for value creation as well as for asset stripping.</p>

<p>I really do think there’s a need for a creative equivalent of <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/">SourceForge</a>; a host for creative projects. Computer game projects put graphics, sound and other content under version control, so artists can certainly do it. For Open creative projects, keeping track of submissions and being able to roll them back is vital to avoid any copyright infringement problems.</p>

<p>If only I was any good at writing NESTA funding proposals. :-)</p>

<p>Hope none of the good stuff was damaged. Do they make flame-retardent canvas?</p>

        Creative Commons 2.0 Licenses Are Out!
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">26 May 2004</span>

    <p>The Creative Commons 2.0 licenses are out.</p>

<p>They cover music and combining works much better than the 1.0 license, but miss the crucial “representation of authority to contribute” clause that makes people think about whether they really are allowed to release Star Wars as Open Content. This <em>was</em> too strict in the original license, but is present in a milder form in several other licenses, and should have been kept in a watered-down form IMHO.</p>

<p>If you are making music or want a good license that allows the kind of cross-media explosion that Lawrence Lessig’s <a href="http://www.free-culture.cc/">“Free Culture”</a> has seen, this is the license for you. If you are concerned about preventing the SCOs of this world attacking Free Culture, the Free Software Foundation’s <a href="http://www.fsf.org/prep/maintain_5.html">procedures for handling contributions</a> may provide a good model.</p>

<p>Congratulations to the CC team for getting these licenses out and for robustly enabling cross-media Free Culture.</p>

        Draw Something More
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">22 May 2004</span>

    <p>The next thing I want to get Draw Something to do is to assemble and draw figures made from several simpler shapes.<br />
The current system starts with a set of random points (or lines, depending on how you look at it), finds the “convex hull” (the simplest shape that contains them), then draws around that. This is a very, very simple analogue to constructive drawing for illustration where shapes are built up around a skeleton or armature and then drawn around to construct a figure. It is a similarly simply analogue to artistic observation and rendering of some part of the visible world.<br />
Following these comparisons, Draw Something assembling simple shapes (convex hulls again) into more complex figures will trivially model assembling or revising a composition from preparatory sketches. The shapes will be generated randomly on the page then moved into position so that they all overlap (making multiple figures is a future task). I like the idea of drawing the starting lines and hulls in light blue, the assembled hulls in darker blue (or red), and the finished outline in black to show how the figure has been assembled (the colours come from drawing for animation).<br />
I was worried that this was an arbitrary task to set the program until I realised that making simpler shapes, composing them and outlining them is exactly how I constructed my “Blobs”. So in fact this is a task I have productively set myself in the past, and it will be interesting to see what Draw Something makes of it.</p>
