    <span class="post-date">09 Dec 2009</span>

    <p>Embracing cliche, and alphabetically -</p>

<p>Good -</p>

<p>Demize - Maleficent (Nine Inch Nails fronted by Danielle Dax rather than Trent Reznor)<br />
Divided - Theoretical Girl (well-observed superior chamber folk )<br />
Djin - Queen Adreena (Heavy and scary, sometimes too much so but worth it anyway)<br />
Flattery Not Included - Mister B The Gentleman Rhymer (sharp, witty chap-hop fun)<br />
From An Ancient Star - Belbury Poly (irresistible mid-life-crisis nostalgia electronica)<br />
Here She Comes A-Tumblin’ - Birdeatsbaby (excellent contemporary cabaret)<br />
Lungs - Florence and the Machine (ignore the soi disant radical music press backlash)<br />
More Mature Escapades in Hi-FI - Furny (surprisingly affecting mash-up satire)<br />
Primary Colours - The Horrors (fun even when you remember the source of the pastiche)<br />
33 - Esben And The Witch (Good post-Goth)</p>

<p>Bad -</p>

<p>Defiance - Lahannya (the industrial version of Ben Elton’s “We Will Rock You”)<br />
Hands - Little Boots (technically competent but aesthetically and affectively vacuous)<br />
Quicksilver - The Cruxshadows (bad Eurodisco is not the future of Goth)<br />
Sunn O’s album (Not heard it, but a million middle-aged music journos can’t be right)<br />
To Lose My Life - White Lies (want to be Joy Division? Work at the Job Centre)<br />
XX - The XX (Remedial Pixies with Doctor Avalanche on drums and no song structure)</p>

<p>What did I miss?</p>

    <p><em>“This is not my song to you and this is not me singing it,<br />
A cover version, words I found, dressed in black with eyes seductive,<br />
Eyes are mirrors of the soul, mirror mine I don’t feel whole,<br />

- ‘Cover Version’, Words and Music.</p>

<p>What is your favourite cover version? Mine are, alphabetically -</p>

<p>Dear Prudence - Siouxsie and The Banshees</p>

<p>Emma - The Sisters of Mercy</p>

<p>Hounds Of Love - The Futureheads</p>

<p>I Could Turn You Inside Out - Words and Music</p>

<p>Jolene - Everyone</p>

<p>Knocking On Heaven’s Door - Everyone</p>

<p>Tainted Love - Soft Cell, Marilyn Manson</p>

<p>If software should not have owners, should songs? In what way are songs not instruments? In what way is the resonance of unique expression not a means for every individual to their own end?</p>

        Copying Is Better
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">28 Nov 2009</span>

    <p>I believe that being free to copy is better for culture, society and the economy than trying to turn copying into the subject of usury. This is a belief I gained at art school and that wasn’t shaken by my experience in industry. But while I can mention many examples of why I believe this to be true, in art and technology and for democracy, I’ve never had the kind of hard numbers to hand that the copyright lobby makes up, er, calculates.</p>

<p>Until now. Enter <a href="http://newsgrist.typepad.com/underbelly/2009/11/immitation-is-good-for-society.html">Newsgrist</a> quoting TechDirt -</p>

<blockquote>_some researchers have started to look into it, and actually have built a model that shows society is likely _better off_ when copying is the norm. [Aaron deOliveira](http://www.techdirt.com/profile.php?u=marroncito) alerts us to the [research on this](http://www.technologyreview.com/blog/arxiv/24409/),
which tries to model societies with creators and innovators, and finds
that society is served best when 30% of the population is involved in
creating new goods, while 70% is focused on copying. Now, you can read
through the [full research](http://arxiv.org/abs/0911.2390)  
and quibble with the methodology, but the basic premise is sound, and
has been borne out in real life, in situations where copying was widely
allowed._
