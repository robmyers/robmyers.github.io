    <span class="post-date">08 Sep 2005</span>

    <p>Pan and zoom are working a little. The concept works, which is a relief. Once I’ve majorly tidied up the code and written an API for getting the cursor position on the page rather than in the window they’ll be done.</p>

<p>Then I can rewrite the toy pen tool to work with that API and you’ll be able to see what you’re drawing when you’ve zoomed in. :-)</p>

<p>I also need to put another buffer under the translate buffer to handle the window resizing. OpenGL and Minara measure positions from the bottom left-hand corner, which chanegs when you resize the window. So when you resize the window the whole image moves, which isn’t right.</p>

<p>I’d ignore number 11, and not everyone agrees that music helps, but the rest are cool. In particular getting up early. I did most of the design for Minara’s pan and zoom tools, and sketches for a new unnamed series of images after getting up early to leave the Novotel in Bristol after <a href="http://www.fave.org.uk/">FAVE</a>.</p>

    <p>Undo works. But not redo. Pressing z makes drawn objects disappear. Pressing Z does nothing.</p>

<p>I think the undo/redo architecture needs reworking. At the moment “marks” go before series of undo events. I think they need to go between, so one at the bottom and top of the stack, with marks on boundaries. Redoing has too much special logic at the moment. It should only have as much special logic as undoing, which will be the case with a mark at the end of the undo list as well as at the beginning.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> undo/redo now works as described. OpenGL transformation matrices and the pan/zoom tools are next.</p>

<p>Traditional freedom of speech is under attack in the UK, and our authors aren’t happy about it. This is traditional creative freedom under attack.</p>

<p>One complaint I’ve heard about free culture is that it’s concerned with edge-cases, with obscure points of law. But this study shows that the rulings handed down on edge-cases set precedents, certainly in US law.</p>

<p>DRM will not keep your secrets safe, it will not help you own digital “property”, and it will not bring about the singularity. As the EFF show, it also doesn’t help your music collection.</p>
