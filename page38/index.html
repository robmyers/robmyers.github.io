        Art Data Analysis: Dissecting The Canon

<p>This is a well-defined statistical study of the art historical literature of a particular period. It counts the number of times that ancient artworks are mentioned in Renaissance art literature. By measuring the popularity and co-popularity of artworks it uncovers several interesting facts.</p>

<p>Firstly, canons are identical with the most popular items over a distribution of popularity. Secondly, sub-tails of genres or subjects have broadly the same properties as the main long tail of which they are a sub-tail. And thirdly the co-popularity of otherwise unrelated monuments may be a product of their spatial proximity at the time they were documented in the renaissance.</p>

<p>These facts are interesting in themselves and indicate further possibilities for research. They are also of use to more theoretical or social art historical approaches.</p>

<p>The first three posts are aesthetic analyses of a large dataset of images that is strongly correlated to human activity (sending messages and dating). The fourth is an attempt to correlate taste with cultural identity. This is all really interesting as quantitative aesthetics.</p>

<p><em>Every year we ask our summer intern to do a survey of cover art elements
for the top  fantasy novels published in the previous year. This year,
our wonderful intern Jennifer looked at covers from 2009, and compared
them against 2008′s findings.  Over the next few days we’ll be releasing
a number of charts that show what she found.</em></p>

    <blockquote>_If an empirically oriented aesthetics uses quantitative averages as norms, it unconsciously sides with social conformity. What such an aesthetics classifies as pleasing or painful is never a sensual given of nature but something preformed by society as a whole, by what it sanctions and censors, and this has always been challenged by artistic production.
