    <p>I first found out about the idea of Live Coding, hacking running code live onstage to generate music and visuals, from an O’Reilley article mentioned on Slashdot.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2004/08/31/livecode.html">The article</a>.</p>

<p>Toplap are the Live Coding masters. They’ve featured at a number of shows.</p>

<p><a href="http://toplap.org/">Toplap’s web site</a>.</p>

<p>Other groups are springing up, such as Openlab, who seem less hardcore about coding live?</p>

<p>Can you really code live? I don’t know. Can you really jam live?</p>

        Flash Formalism
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">23 Jan 2005</span>

    <p>Like all good names for art movements, “Flash Formalism” came about as a criticism of a perceived negative trend. That trend is the increase of work based on mathematical or algorithmic aesthetics, at first written with Flash and increasingly with Processing.</p>

<p>“Formalism” is a damning accusation for a critic to level at a work. Work which has only form, not content, is presumably vacuous. Certainly it has no critical potential. And yet the requirement that work have obvious, easily recovered content that critics can relate to their existing theories is a requirement of <em>illustration</em>, not critical content. That is, there’s a difference between illustrating critical theory and making something that stretches or even breaks critical theory. If the search-engine chic and in-faux-mation graphics of vaguely political net.art is more to criticism’s tastes, I’d say it’s criticism that has the problem.</p>

<p>Refusal of illustrative content is a political position. And given how complicit would-be net.art criticism is with existing power structures it’s actually a very critical position. It is a position that presents a genuine and useful challenge to and for criticism.</p>

<p>Like process art or the original computer art, both dating from the hardly apolitical 60s and 70s, Flash Formalism is not an art without social meaning. It is just a meaning that cannot immediately be reduced to sound-bite Poststucturalism. It is also a meaning that is not merely textual, another cardinal sin. It is mathematical.</p>

<p>Mathematics is not undemocratic: anyone can learn some maths. And it is not anti-individualistic: theorems and proofs are named after their discoverers. Alan Badiou claims that ontology is mathematics, and uses many mathematical concepts in his philosophy, so maths isn’t unreflective. Whatever narcissistic claims theory may make for “the text”, we live in a mathematically determined culture, not a textually determined one.</p>

<p>What the mathematics of Flash Formalism shows us is an analogue for an increasingly procedural social and aesthetic world. It shows us a simultaneous concretisation of and abstraction from it, a simultaneous engagement and an escape. No wonder it is so intractable for net.art criticism. It takes subtlety and imagination to see how this work relates to and allows a critique of where we are. You can’t just write about it.</p>

    <p>I’ve had a busy evening. Some of the better results from purely random colour choosing:<br />
<img src="/assets/drawing3.png" alt="" /><img src="/assets/drawing1.png" alt="" /><img src="/assets/drawing2.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>It’s doubly cheating: there’s no intelligent choice in the colours, and the shapes (and ground) are being filled by a PostScript fill call rather than with a painting algorithm. This is all temporary. In particular, working out why some random colour schemes are better than others will help to decide how to choose colours more intelligently.</p>

    <span class="post-date">19 Jan 2005</span>

    <p>A probabilistic pen for draw-something that uncannily resembles my freehand line:<br />
<img src="/assets/drawing3.png" alt="" /><img src="/assets/drawing1.png" alt="" /><img src="/assets/drawing2.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The first image is a drawing around a convex hull, the other two are drawings around polylines.</p>

<p>How likely the pen is to turn left or right depends on how far it is from an ideal distance from the form it is drawing around. I’ve seen some mis-drawing so far (not shown), so the algorithm (or its parameters) needs some fine tuning, but I’m very pleased with how this looks.</p>

<p><a href="http://homepage.mac.com/robmyers/weblog/C1033636084/E18347670/index.html">Here’s how the deterministic pen draws</a>.</p>

    <span class="post-date">18 Jan 2005</span>

    <p>I’ve made the source code for draw-something more readable and modular, ready for the next round of development. So code that read like this:</p>

<pre><code>(defmethod draw-around ((poly polyline) (han hand)) "Draw around a polygon using a hand." (let* ((the-hand (start-drawing poly han)) (first-point (location han)) (sketch (list first-point))) ;;Make the rest, finishing when &lt; step from the original point (loop (let ((next-point (draw-step poly the-hand))) (setf sketch (cons next-point sketch)) ;; If the list is longer than two segments (1.2.nil) ;; And the current point is passing close to the first point (when (and (&gt; (length sketch) 2) (&lt; (distance next-point first-point) (speed han))) ;; Close the path... ;;REVISITME: This is too perfect... (setf sketch (cons first-point sketch)) ;; Returns from the enclosing block, not the function! (return nil)))) sketch))
</code></pre>

<p>now reads more like this (in part):</p>

<pre><code>(defmethod ensure-next-pen-close-enough ((poly polyline) (p pen)) "If the pen would move too far next time, turn it right until it wouldn't." (while (next-pen-too-far poly p) (turn-right p (turn-step p)))) (defmethod adjust-next-pen ((poly polyline) (p pen)) "Set the pen back on the correct path around the shape." (ensure-next-pen-far-enough poly p) (ensure-next-pen-close-enough poly p)) (defmethod draw-step ((poly polyline) (p pen)) "Find the next point forward along the drawn outline of the shape." (adjust-next-pen poly p) (move-forward p (speed p)) (location p))
</code></pre>

<p>Which is much easier to understand and work with. Next up is a “probabilistic pen” if I can get that to work, and a simple colouring algorithm.</p>
