        How VRML 2 Destroyed Internet VR For A Decade
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">19 Jun 2008</span>

    <p>In the mid-1990s there were four problems with internet-based Virtual Reality (VR).</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The plug-ins were all for Windows, not Mac. Ignoring early adopters and designers is a bad idea when launching a new visual medium.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People’s PCs had anaemic graphics cards and processors. Skilful design could offset this, though.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People were on 24-56k dial-up modems for the most part. Again, skilful design could offset this but it did set a limit.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>VRML 2 was an unimplementable turd of a standard. It destroyed any company that tried to implement it.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>I think people underestimate the Mac angle. Apple had a miniscule market share but Macs were disproportionately represented on the Internet and within that there were a disproportionate number of the kinds of people you need making and consuming your new medium if you want it to succeed. But I digress.</p>

<p>Reading the VRML 2 standard when it first came out I was struck by its complexity and by the naivete of some of the implementation notes. I couldn’t see how to implement it without much more work than the notes seemed to suggest was needed.</p>

<p>Events showed my concerns to be well founded. Cosmo, SGI’s VR outfit, was spun off and failed before they managed to finish implementing VRML 2. Intervista also failed to implement it and got bought out. A trend was emerging. Try to implement VRML 2, fail, lose your company.</p>

<p>VRML 1 had been OK. Black Sun had based a multi-user VR system on it. It would have been better for VRML 2 not to have been specified and for VRML 1 to remain the standard with external animation added by the likes of Black Sun than for VRML 2 to destroy the industry.</p>

<p>A couple of years ago the corpse of VRML 2 was exhumed and wrapped in XML to produce X3D. The problem with VRML 2 was not that it wasn’t verbose enough, and wrapping it in an extra layer of verbosity in the form of XML tackled the wrong problem. As a comparison, SVG is basically PDF in XML but it is easier to parse than PDF and better suited to inline web graphics because of the choices that were made when considering which bits of PDF should be included or left out.</p>

<p>VRML 2 played a unique part in the failure of the first wave of Internet virtual reality. It wasn’t until the mid-2000s that a second wave arrived with less powerful scene description than VRML 1 and a walled-garden, service-based approach that is at odds with the freedom of the hypertext internet that VRML sought to extend.</p>

<p>I long for the return of internet virtual reality based on open standards, distributed client-server systems, and text-file-hackability. With meshes.</p>

    <p>A debate about net art at Rhizome.org has some of the younger hipsters of the New York internet art scene circling the wagons. I’m not sure what around.</p>

<p>There’s not being careful what you wish for and then there’s not being touched by your own irony. Surf Clubs remind me of the night club events I’ve been to that have been organized by cultural studies lecturers. Empty dancefloors with a few scattered would-be observers around the edges.</p>

<p>Turning the dross of popular media into fine art has a long pedigree, one that I am invested and implicated in. Art may be the superstructure of kitsch. Animated gifs and lolcats are not immune from this, in fact they are a logical progression. Internet time is measured in months, and to ironically act out a group blog a la 2001 in 2006 is no worse temporally speaking than screen-printing Marilyn Monroe in 1962. Or 1984.</p>

<p>But to act out acting out, that is to make a performance of a culture that is already more performative than the artist’s performance, and to regard oneself as terribly clever for doing so misses a layer of irony. Several layers of irony. And to be terribly offended by people mistaking what you are doing for what you are doing shows that you should retain a lawyer before rubbing any lamps.</p>

<p>Yes, I am curmudgeonly about the current state of the internet. But the Jemima Puddleduck economics and reified, servicized social relations of Web 2.0 isn’t a case of be careful what you wish for, it’s a case of don’t pawn the family silver. And even within inauthenticity there can be refinement. Hipsterism is an ethic of consumption masquerading as an aesthetic of flaneurie. Compared to that, the technohippies of the early 1990s were gods.</p>

    <p>I’m not a US citizen so I’ve been staying out of the Orphan Works Bill debate for the most part. But I am getting more and more emails about it and reading more and more blog post about it. All are against the bill, so to balance this here are some pro-Orphan Works Bill posts:</p>

    <p>One of the tenets I hold to is that creative genius is often transformative. Yes, creating a new axiom is amazing, but as much as Shakespeare created new forms and idioms in English that have lasted for centuries he also plagiarized existing work. The two may not be unrelated. But in our current culture of the monetization of small differences (what is the difference between yBA art and German art of the 1960s and 1970s, or between Britney and Christina?) they have a restraining order on each other.</p>

<p>This brings us, as Crosbie has already guessed, to Star Wars (the title is an improvised exchange from “The Empire Strikes Back”, the work in the series that transformed the initial impact of the first film into a lasting cultural touchpoint. Harrison Ford was also present when Rutger Hauer improvised the climactic “tears in the rain” speech of Bladerunner, but I digress…).</p>

<p>The book <a href="http://www.secrethistoryofstarwars.com/book.html">“The Secret History Of Star Wars”</a> carefully destroys George Lucas’s claims of a creative immaculate conception for the series, leaving a story of creative desperation, appropriation, and lucky escapes that presents each film in the Star Wars series as a destructive digression from the one that precedes it. It takes the claims of a mythology for our times and shows that it is based on the dross of popular culture. “I am your father” was a fix for a creative problem, as was “she is your sister”. The plot of Star Wars was taken from a classic Japanese film, The Empire Strikes Back escaped George Lucas’s control while providing the best realization of his vision and Return Of The Jedi was a case of recycling and readjusting to embrace, extend and escape a plot that would otherwise have been entirely determined by what had been promised before.</p>

<p>In other words it reveals Lucas’s creative genius. It is well worth a read for anyone interested in popular culture, creativity or aesthetics. And it contains strong hints for Free Culture activists. You won’t love Jar Jar Binks after reading it, but you will understand him.</p>

<p>“So you see what I told you was true. From a certain point of view.”</p>

    <p>And it’s brilliant. Seriously, these guys know more about classic humorously violent funny animal cartoons than Dreamworks animators have ever been told they can’t use by their managerial overlords.</p>

<p>See here for downloads: <a href="http://www.bigbuckbunny.org/index.php/download/">Big Buck Bunny Downloads</a></p>

<p>And buy the 2 DVD set for PAL &amp; NTSC versions of the cartoon as well as all the “source” used to make it, the 3D models, textures, animations, etc: <a href="http://www.blender3d.org/e-shop/product_info.php?products_id=97">Big Buck Bunny DVD</a></p>

<p>But will the soundtrack be released under a Free licence this time?</p>
