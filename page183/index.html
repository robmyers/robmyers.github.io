<p><em>After ten issues, The Commoner makes the first timid steps toward changing format and organisation, towards making more explicit and visible the practices of cyber commoning it is grounded on. Watch this space, we are slow, but things will happen. Meanwhile, enjoy the edition that our two guest editors, Nate Holdren and Stevphen Shukaitis, have put together, an edition in which the different contributions are traversed by the problematic of commoning.</em></p>

<p><em>The UK Royal Society, the oldest “learned society” in the world, will try publishing some of its journals under open access licensing.</em></p>

<p><a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/06/20/wendy_seltzer_smokes.html">Boing Boing: Wendy Seltzer smokes the MPAA in the Wall St Journal</a></p>

<p><em>My pal and former EFF attorney Wendy Seltzer conducted a debate with MPPA exec Fritz Attaway in the pages of the Wall Street Journal. In it, Wendy makes mincemeat of Attaway’s arguments, which keep coming around to accusing her of wanting to commit piracy and rip off artists, which, as she explains over and over again, isn’t what she’s trying to do at all</em></p>

<p><a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/06/20/pete_seeger_tribute_.html">Boing Boing: Pete Seeger tribute disc locked down with Dr0</a></p>

<p><em>Such irony: Bruce Springsteen recorded a tribute album for Pete Seeger, anti-property agitator and old-guard leftist. Springsteen’s label slapped a super-restrictive DRM on the disc that prevents PC playback, ripping to MP3, and lots of other freedoms that are totally in synch with the poltiical messages in Seeger’s music.</em></p>

<p><em>The ad collects a century-worth of fear mongering by an industry focused on legislating to protect out-dated business models, rather than adjusting to changing market opportunities:</em></p>

<p><em>“I forsee a marked deterioration in American music…and a host of other injuries to music in its artistic manifestations, by virtue”or rather by vice”of the multiplication of the various music-reproducing machines…” -John Philip Sousa on the Player Piano (1906)</em></p>

    <p><a href="http://drawn.ca/2006/06/21/zoomorphic-calligraphy/">Drawn! The Illustration and Cartooning Blog Â» Blog Archive Â» Zoomorphic Calligraphy</a>_Our friend Peacay over at BibliOdyssey has posted a number of fascinating pieces of Islamic art in the form of zoomorphic calligraphy. This piece, like several others on his site, is by a Sudanese artist named Hassan Musa (see also)._This (but more the art of Dr. Ahmed Moustafa) is the sort of thing that led to <a href="/art/psychetecture">Psychetecture</a>.</p>

<p><em>For many years I have been making things…small sculptured heads, masks, jewelry, drums, etc….which appear to be artifacts (fetishes, totems, allies) from some primitive tribal culture. The materials and techniques used to make the objects are both ancient (bones, stones, horn, hand-shaping, chipping, cutting etc.) and high tech (acrylic polymer clay and paint, digital scanning and image manipulation, archival Ultrachrome printing, etc.). People who have seen these objects cannot put their finger on what part of the world or time period they may be from, and I have not attempted to copy artifacts I might have seen from any particular culture or period. The only way that I can account for the nature of this “evidence” is to say that it has simply emerged from some imaginal region and time.</em></p>

<p>‘Pataphysical art.</p>

<p><em>let me begin with a brief discussion of what copyright is in the first place. That’s as much as I can cover in this first column.</em></p>

<p><em>I want to begin there, with that most basic question, because I’ve found that many people”including an astonishingly high percentage of authors”have the most preposterous misconceptions about it.</em></p>

    <p><a href="http://dev1.manme.org.uk/~davem/RSScomic_1.2/index.php?input_rss=2">newscomic</a></p>

<p><em>newscomic recycles the news, re-mixes it, subverts and distorts it. It takes live news feeds (RSS feeds) from major news sources, chops them up at random and puts the resultant text into speech bubbles in a comic. The comic illustrations reflect the current latest news, and are regularly updated to keep up with the news. The result is a disjointed comic, where the words and pictures don’t quite fit but make their own story.</em></p>

<p>_Often the story is quite surreal, but can by chance make sense, and even be quite revealing. _</p>

<p>Kinda like paintr for sequential art.</p>
